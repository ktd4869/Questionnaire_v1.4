Here's how: </p><p id=p144>Go to the account's profile.Tap the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-19' style='color:red'>menu</span>icon.Select <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-20' style='color:red'>Settings.Select</span>About This Account.There, you'll be able to check out when the account was created, the country it's located in, accounts with shared followers, a year-long history of any name changes, and any ads the account is currently running.This new feature reflects the push for transparency around advertisements and who buys them: a push that arose after <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-21' style='color:red'>Russian</span>conspirators purchased ads on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-22' style='color:red'>social media</span>spread disinformation  and promote discord-fomenting rallies during the 2016 US presidential election. </p><p id=p230>Krieger said that this is what the Instagram community is asking for: a way to get a better understanding of accounts that reach a lot of people, particularly when such accounts share information about current events, or political or social causes, for example. </p><p id=p273>If users stumble across an account that seems to violate the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-23' style='color:red'>platform's</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-24' style='color:red'>Community</span>Guidelines, Instagram says that they can report it. </p><p id=p294>In September, the tool will be made available to accounts with a big reach.

Requirements include complying with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-28' style='color:red'>Instagram's</span>Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. After that, the platform will review verification requests to confirm the "authenticity, uniqueness, completeness and notability of each account." </p><p id=p409>To find out more, check out <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-29' style='color:red'>Instagram's verification</span>at its </p><p id=p422>To access the verification request form: </p><p id=p428>Go to your profile.Tap the menu icon.Select <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-30' style='color:red'>Settings.Choose</span>Request Verification.You'll be asked to provide your account username, full name, and a copy of your legal or business information.

If they can convince a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-36' style='color:red'>mobile</span>phone shop that they are you, they can get them to issue a replacement SIM encoded with your phone number. Your phone will go dead, and theirs will start receiving your calls and messages, including 2FA codes. An alleged <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-37' style='color:red'>SIM-swap</span>scammer was recently arrested for allegedly stealing $5m in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-38' style='color:red'>Bitcoin</span>and other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-39' style='color:red'>cryptocurrencies,</span>for example <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-40' style='color:red'>.NIST</span>has declared that we can stick a fork in SMS-based 2FA: it's done.Here's how to set up your Instagram account to use a third-party authenticator app: </p><p id=p618>Go to your profile.Tap the Menu icon.Select Settings.Choose Two-Factor Authentication.Select Authentication App.If you've already installed an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-41' style='color:red'>authentication app,</span>will automatically find it and send it a login code.

That will automatically turn on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-42' style='color:red'>2FA.If</span>you haven't already installed an authentication app, Instagram will shuffle you on over to Apple's App Store or Google Play to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-43' style='color:red'>download</span>the app of your choosing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-44' style='color:red'>(Sophos</span>has you covered here: consider downloading Sophos Authenticator which is also included in our free Sophos Mobile Security for Android and iOS). Once you've installed your chosen authenticator, return to Instagram to continue setting up 2FA. </p><p id=p730><span class='token pointer' id='tok-99-45' style='color:red'>Boosting</span>Instagram securityThese three new tools are a welcome addition to boost Instagram accounts' security and to provide transparency into the sources of content and who's advertising what on where.
