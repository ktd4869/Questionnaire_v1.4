<p id=p0>A security awareness program can be an extremely valuable tool. It helps an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-0' style='color:red'>organization</span>thwart active attacks and reduces the amount of weaknesses that can be exploited by an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-1' style='color:red'>attacker.</span>However, just as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-2' style='color:red'>organizations</span>differ in size, purpose and mission, the attacks directed at them also differ in method, skill set and motivation. </p><p id=p53>How can an organization build a security awareness program that takes all of these factors into account to ultimately create a tailored awareness program that fits its unique personality? </p><p id=p82>This is an important question, since awareness <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-3' style='color:red'>programs</span>usually mean a significant investment in time and funds. If the awareness program is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-4' style='color:red'>built</span>correctly, however, the organization can actually save considerable funds by avoiding issues such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-5' style='color:red'>forensic</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-6' style='color:red'>extended incident response work,</span>disclosures to clients of any compromised data due to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-7' style='color:red'>breaches</span>and so forth. </p><p id=p138>These issues can be catastrophic in impact, but they almost always begin with a small <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-8' style='color:red'>exposure</span>that is leveraged into a larger problem. With this in mind, the first step in building an awareness program is: </p><p id=p174>Understand Your Organization's PersonalityPut bluntly: what are your weaknesses? What do you handle badly from a security standpoint? </p><p id=p192>In this instance, an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-9' style='color:red'>risk assessment</span>prove to be very valuable in finding some of these areas. This however can be very expensive and involves much more time. Are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-10' style='color:red'>there</span>any alternatives? </p><p id=p226>Consider this option. Most organizations track their security incidents using some type of ticket system, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-11' style='color:red'>database</span>or even a spreadsheet in some cases. (If your organization is not doing this, it needs to be implemented immediately). </p><p id=p262>At a minimum, this system should track items such as: </p><p id=p272>Incident type <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-12' style='color:red'>(Phishing</span>attempt, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-13' style='color:red'>credential</span>compromise, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-14' style='color:red'>spam,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-15' style='color:red'>hack</span>attempt, successful compromise, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-16' style='color:red'>engineering)Severity</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-17' style='color:red'>social</span>by high, medium and low)Incident notes or descriptionIncident start date/time as well as the incident close date/timeIndividual reporting the issue (victim or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-18' style='color:red'>observer)This</span>information alone can quickly start to paint a picture of how much time these incidents are taking your security team to resolve, and which incident types are truly an immediate threat to your organization. For example, does the data show that your employees are continually falling victim to bogus phone scams? Are corporate machines repeatedly being infected when employees click on suspect links provided in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-19' style='color:red'>phishing</span>emails? Are certain individuals or divisions being targeted by certain <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-20' style='color:red'>threats?</span>Once you're able to determine where the weakness is, you can work to create a program that includes standard security items but focuses on your particular area of need. </p><p id=p415>Another benefit to gathering this data is that it affords your organization's IR Team with an opportunity to commend your employees for what they are doing well. To illustrate: are employees reporting problems regardless of their status? Do they seek guidance before interacting with a suspect message, or do you find that your IR Team is completely blindsided by certain threats? </p><p id=p476>Even if employees are reporting incidents after they've been impacted, this is a positive action, as it shows that employees know who to contact and that they are seeking guidance. Whenever an employee is engaged in this circumstance, they should be commended then given very specific guidance. This can be information pertaining to how they should handle a similar case in the future, next steps that need to be followed or any other brief information your team deems necessary. </p><p id=p555>Once this interaction is complete, the IR member should be sure to log the details of the issue. Having the name of the individual can help the security team determine which employees or division are having continual problems and may need more specific training or reminders. </p><p id=p601>The positive commendation can help to create a spirit of teamwork and can contribute to employees viewing the IR and security teams as allies as opposed to disciplinarians. This will ultimately help the security team by increasing the number of eyes and ears on watch. </p><p id=p646><span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-21' style='color:red'>Communication</span>Methods Once you've identified your organization's personality and areas that need to be strengthened, you can start to consider communication methods. Which vehicle can be used to disseminate the needed information or training to your target groups? Do you have many common areas such as cafeterias, lounges or other areas where employees tend to congregate or regularly traverse? </p><p id=p705>Depending on your company's layout you can consider items such as: </p><p id=p716>Digital SignageIf digital monitors are placed in common areas, the security team can use these to show security related <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-22' style='color:red'>messages</span>that relate to areas that need to be strengthened. If there is a corporate graphics team, they can assist by creating attractive combinations of photos to complement the presentation of these simple security related reminders. The security team can create several digital <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-23' style='color:red'>posters</span>that can cycle through on this medium. </p><p id=p786><span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-24' style='color:red'>Static</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-25' style='color:red'>Posters</span>The security team can have their digital posters printed on higher-quality glossy card stock and place these in key areas. The sizes of these posters can vary, and they can be placed strategically near doorways, in elevators, hallways and near offices and cubicles. </p><p id=p831>Screensavers Yes, screensavers! This tool has tremendous potential, as computer monitors are probably the device with the greatest penetration in any organization. Everyone needs a monitor, and every monitor has a screensaver. </p><p id=p863>The image files for digital safety posters can be saved to a network location, and the security team can leverage group policy to push a "corporate screensaver" to all managed devices relatively quickly. This provides thorough dissemination and the security team can have the assurance that all employees will eventually see and read all related security reminders. </p><p id=p920>Another benefit this option provides is agility. If there is a need to change the message employees see, the security team simply needs to create a different set of posters and point group policy to the new images. When using this option, the security team can create a power management policy that will balance the need for security awareness and corporate energy efficiency. </p><p id=p983>Branding This option allows your security team to create a presence that is easily remembered by employees. Developing a slogan, acronym or logo that identifies your security team or some function they perform can help in this regard. </p><p id=p1021>Once this has been created, it can be used on awareness messages and awareness tools. Some companies maintain a small budget to purchase small giveaways that are branded with the logo or message of choice. If this option is used it would be best to find an item that, while inexpensive, has some practical value to employees. Items like portable power banks, phone stands, stress balls, coffee mugs or microfiber screen-cleaning cloths are things that will be repeatedly used and seen. </p><p id=p1102>These communication vehicles can help a security team create a buzz and in time, establish their presence to employees. </p><p id=p1121>Security Awareness Days Some organizations also maintain a budget for select days in the year where security items can be presented to employees in a manner reminiscent of a trade show. Using the information on the organization's specific weak areas, the security team can develop demonstrations of security threats affecting the company. For example, if phishing is a problem, demonstrations such as "How to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-26' style='color:red'>detect</span>a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-153-27' style='color:red'>malicious</span>message" or "What is Phishing?" may be appropriate. </p><p id=p1196>Conclusion: As mentioned previously these methods are by no means exhaustive. However, by following these suggestions an organization can begin creating a security awareness program that can provide practical benefits for its employees.
