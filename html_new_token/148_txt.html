The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-148-15' style='color:red'>victim</span>would pay a "worthiness" fee to demonstrate "ability to repay the loan".

They used <span class='token pointer' id='tok-148-30' style='color:red'>voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP)</span>and would spoof the call as coming from US or Canadian numbers.

It is a reality, telephone contact is often the only contact some older people and others have, and they relish the opportunity to engage. Or they don't wish to be rude to the individual calling and thus will listen and engage. Having a script next to the telephone is one way to help move the call toward termination.

Don't forget that scams still come via snail <span class='token pointer' id='tok-148-35' style='color:red'>mail,</span>too. If you think a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-148-36' style='color:red'>letter</span>might be official, look up the phone number they're giving to check that it's really from the organization it claims to be. If the number you look up is different to the one on the letter you've received, call that number and ask them to verify what's in the letter you've had. This is especially important when it comes to the IRS, who will only communicate with you via mail, unless you originate or arrange a telephone appointment. </p><p id=p1251>In every instance, do report the attempt to defraud you to the appropriate authorities, and tell your neighbors and family members.
