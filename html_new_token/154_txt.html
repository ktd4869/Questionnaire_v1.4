<p id=p0>A recent survey by the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-0' style='color:red'>Cloud</span>Security Alliance found, among other things, that out of a sampling of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-1' style='color:red'>alerts,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-2' style='color:red'>2,542 anomalous event</span>23.2 percent were actual <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-3' style='color:red'>threats</span>— the rest were <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-4' style='color:red'>false positives.</span>is one reason <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-5' style='color:red'> "alert</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-6' style='color:red'>fatigue"</span>persists, plaguing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-7' style='color:red'>security</span>teams in many organizations and across industries. To fully understand the implications of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-8' style='color:red'>alert</span>fatigue and the role it plays in failing to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-9' style='color:red'>prevent</span>damaging <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-10' style='color:red'>breaches,</span>it's important to dig a little deeper into its causes. </p><p id=p79>Alert fatigue describes the situation when security teams are inundated with alerts, making it impossible for them to investigate and respond to each one. Consequently, a serious alert can be overlooked until it it's too late. There are numerous high profile breaches attributed to alert fatigue, one of the most infamous being the Target breach. </p><p id=p134>There are a number of reasons alert fatigue persists in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-11' style='color:red'>cybersecurity</span>community. Here are some examples of why an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-12' style='color:red'>IT</span>security team might suffer from this problem: </p><p id=p162>Complex IT environments: </p><p id=p165>It wasn't that long ago that IT environments consisted largely of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-13' style='color:red'>centrally managed</span>components with tight <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-14' style='color:red'>integrations.</span>Change happened slowly and systems were fairly easy to monitor and control. However, today's vast mixture of physical and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-15' style='color:red'>virtual</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-16' style='color:red'>infrastructures,</span>as well as countless applications and a myriad of solutions that need to perform in concert, has dramatically increased the sources for alerts. Adding more frustration is the fact that the internal IT teams required to monitor these more sophisticated tools haven't expanded at the same rate, resulting in complex noisy environments, without the staff needed to respond effectively. </p><p id=p263>Lack of context: </p><p id=p266><span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-17' style='color:red'>Alerts</span>arriving with no context or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-18' style='color:red'>actionable information</span>can lead a security team down a rabbit hole trying to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-19' style='color:red'>remediate</span>the situations. To be effective, an alert needs to paint a complete picture, including the source of the problem, what machines are impacted and any other details necessary to allow IT security to quickly analyze and neutralize the threat completely. </p><p id=p327>Alert redundancy:  </p><p id=p330>If a security team is receiving dozens or hundreds of alerts for the same issue, it's easy to see how alert fatigue can happen. It may be a question of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-20' style='color:red'>fine-tuning tolerances</span>some of your security tools, or it could be that you have <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-21' style='color:red'>layers of non-integrated security solutions</span>bombarding you with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-22' style='color:red'>redundant</span>alerts. That's why it's important to consolidate and correlate threat data and perhaps move to a more integrated, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-23' style='color:red'>platform-based</span>security solution. </p><p id=p406>Increase in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-24' style='color:red'>false</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-25' style='color:red'>positives:</span> </p><p id=p411>As in the case of redundant alerts, combining multiple sources for alerts with poorly-tuned, uncoordinated or inadequate security tools will <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-26' style='color:red'>inevitably</span>lead to more false positives. This results in alert fatigue because it's human nature to become inured to alerts if the majority of them are false – in a sea of false positives, the true positive is likely to be missed. </p><p id=p473>Alert delivery issues: </p><p id=p476>If alerts aren't going to the right <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-27' style='color:red'>people</span>on your team, or the right people don't have the right access, important alerts can get missed. There can also be a problem if low priority alerts are being delivered in the same timeframe as high priority notifications. For instance, if your team is getting low priority alerts consistently at all hours, don't be surprised if one day someone ignores an important alert that arrived at 2 am. </p><p id=p552>What is the Solution to Alert Fatigue? </p><p id=p559><span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-28' style='color:red'>Automation</span>Tools are Important </p><p id=p563>The robust nature of today's cybercrime, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-29' style='color:red'>hacktivism</span>and nation state <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-30' style='color:red'>attacks</span>means that noisy alerting will not diminish any time soon. While many security <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-31' style='color:red'>vendors</span>promote their abilities to correlate, contextualize and consolidate threats, the rapidly evolving threat landscape makes dialing back the noise a challenging objective. Endpoint security tools that include machine learning and behavioral analysis can be critical in providing triage support for your internal IT security team, reducing overall alert volume, as well as cutting down on redundant alerts and false positives. However, accurate and lasting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-32' style='color:red'>remediation</span>still requires human intervention, particularly given today's complex threat landscape. </p><p id=p663>Managed Threat Hunting is Key </p><p id=p668>Eliminating the consequences of alert fatigue while ensuring that stealthy attacks can be detected and analyzed immediately, have made proactive threat hunting a necessity for organizations in every <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-33' style='color:red'>market</span>sector. Unfortunately, building an internal threat hunting team is challenging. The tasks of resourcing, staffing and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-154-34' style='color:red'>operationalizing</span>this capability is simply out of reach for most organizations' IT security teams. </p><p id=p727>This is why the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform includes Falcon OverWatch™, an elite team of expert threat hunters who work around the clock to detect, analyze and eliminate adversaries threatening clients' environments. The CrowdStrike team works alongside internal security teams to eliminate alert fatigue by going beyond alerting to focus on subtle signs of attacks that might lead to a serious compromise if left unattended. They analyze the complete context of the threats an organization is facing and prioritize them to remediate instantly, before incidents turn into full-blown breaches. Falcon OverWatch threat hunters are currently stopping more than two breaches per hour for CrowdStrike clients. </p><p id=p831>To learn more about Falcon OverWatch, and how it can improve security posture while alleviating alert fatigue, register for the live webcast:  Proactive Threat Hunting: Game-Changing Endpoint Protection Above and Beyond Alerting.
