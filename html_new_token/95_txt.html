<p id=p0>How to Avoid the Common Pitfalls While Browsing the WebBy Amanda McKeon on January 28, 2016 </p><p id=p16>Web browser <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-0' style='color:red'>exploits</span>are on the rise due to the ease with which they are executed. Too often, the user starts with the browser that ships with their device and then downloads from the pre-installed browser their favorite browser. </p><p id=p55>The problem? </p><p id=p57>The default <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-1' style='color:red'>configuration</span>on the original browser is probably not secure in the first place, plus it's rarely removed after the preferred browser is subsequently installed, leaving opportunities for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-2' style='color:red'>exploitation.</span>The downloaded browser, too, may not have a secure default configuration, and every time it's used, new vulnerabilities are waiting.  </p><p id=p108>"Click to install" is very convenient, but it can lead to troublesome vulnerabilities, including <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-3' style='color:red'>malware,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-4' style='color:red'>remote code execution,</span>of privacy, stolen data, or even </p><p id=p136>This last point is especially concerning for security professionals, since their organization's typical user isn't concerned with security when using their favorite browser to surf the web, but it can lead to disastrous consequences for the organization. </p><p id=p173>Here are a few tips security pros can pass along to users (and family and friends) for safe internet browsing. </p><p id=p193>Disable <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-5' style='color:red'>Third-Party CookiesWebsites</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-6' style='color:red'>cookies</span>that store data about a user's browsing activity to enhance the user's experience. </p><p id=p211>For <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-7' style='color:red'>instance,</span>data about search habits, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-8' style='color:red'>geolocation,</span>or site preferences are used to help tailor the content the user sees or remember what the user last did when visiting the site. Cookies are saved as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-9' style='color:red'>packets</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-10' style='color:red'>little</span>data on the user's machine and sent back to the browsed site each time the user returns. Cookies are designed to be readable only by the website that created them.  </p><p id=p280>This goes for advertisements placed on the host web page, too. Any <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-11' style='color:red'>advertiser</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-12' style='color:red'>who</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-13' style='color:red'>embeds</span>an ad on a web page — and there are many which is why so much content is served up for free — has the ability to track a user's habits, location, and preferences. </p><p id=p329>Ever wonder why, suddenly, you are seeing helpful "suggestions" for diet and exercise programs near you after you've written an email mentioning a desire for salad from a web browser? </p><p id=p359>Yeah, those are cookies (and not the tasty kind you can eat after the salad).  </p><p id=p375>These third-party cookies are helpful to the advertiser, but in the hands of a malicious adversary, a user's privacy and security can be compromised. In addition, some websites use cookies for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-14' style='color:red'>authentication,</span>which means that if an attacker gains access to credentials, he can gain unauthorized access to the site and/or other areas of the user's system, unbeknownst to the user.  </p><p id=p437>A stealthy attacker can build a profile of a user if he is persistent enough, and this is dangerous to the user and potentially the organization to which the user's system is connected. </p><p id=p470>Fortunately, most modern browsers allow for control of privacy settings and users can disable third-party cookies and keep their browsing habits more secure. Because most browsers allow third-party cookies by default, the user should adjust his or her settings as soon as the browser is installed. </p><p id=p516>Enable <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-15' style='color:red'>"Click to Play"</span>Third-Party ContentPDF and Flash are two well-known vulnerable content delivery mechanisms that are also ubiquitous. Websites use Flash to enhance the user's experience, and the more interactive web content becomes, the more it is used by businesses that want to engage customers and create stickiness for their brand. </p><p id=p569>PDF is used constantly and consistently across businesses to create more official, professional-looking, and unalterable documents. Unfortunately, Adobe vulnerabilities are also well known. Patches for Adobe vulnerabilities are issued regularly, but often it's after an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-16' style='color:red'>exploit,</span>and, as all security pros know, patching doesn't occur as frequently as it should. </p><p id=p619>Adobe isn't the only concern; Java, HTML5, and other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-17' style='color:red'>markup</span>languages are commonly the basis for interactive web-based content. This content, along with USBs and other removable media, are typically set to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-18' style='color:red'>AutoPlay</span>— a feature that can introduce malicious code on a user's system. For example, an infected USB was the source of infection for the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-19' style='color:red'>Stuxnet</span>virus, which illustrates the disastrous effects AutoPlay can cause.  </p><p id=p687>To eliminate the problem of AutoPlay, disable it through the settings in your control panel. Additionally, be sure to update old versions of tools and apply patches regularly. </p><p id=p715>Use an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-20' style='color:red'>Add-On</span>Like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-21' style='color:red'>NoScriptJavaScript,</span>also known as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-22' style='color:red'>ECMAScript,</span>is a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-23' style='color:red'>scripting language</span>to make websites more interactive and user friendly. </p><p id=p738>JavaScript is also responsible for several malicious attack types like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-24' style='color:red'>(XSS)</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-25' style='color:red'>cross-site scripting</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-26' style='color:red'>(XSRF).</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-27' style='color:red'>cross-site request forgery</span>vulnerabilities can occur because JavaScript is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-28' style='color:red'>embedded</span>in an HTML page so the site can perform specific functions, like serving up an online form, for example. The problem with JavaScript, however, is that it interacts with the web page <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-29' style='color:red'>(DOM)</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-30' style='color:red'>Document Object Model</span>executes malicious content or obtains unauthorized permissions from the site. </p><p id=p811>To keep sites that use JavaScript safer, users should employ add-on services like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-31' style='color:red'>NoScript,</span>which only allows executable content if the site is trusted and has been <span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-32' style='color:red'>whitelisted.</span></p><p id=p839>NoScript is a free, open source status bar that is installed on the user's computer after download and appears on every page the user visits. As with disabling AutoPlay, a service like NoScript gives the user more granular control of what can and cannot run on his or her system.  </p><p id=p890><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-33' style='color:red'>Don't Ignore Browser</span>updates are bothersome but can be one of the best ways to keep web browsing secure. </p><p id=p910>Old, outdated browser versions may not have the ability to discover current vulnerabilities, which are issued daily. Malicious websites take advantage of out-of-date browsers because it's an easy and low-cost way to compromise a user's machine.  </p><p id=p947>Many browsers will prompt the user when it's time for an update, but users can also check their own versions: </p><p id=p967>Internet Explorer: To turn on automatic updates, click the Internet Explorer icon on the taskbar, select the Tools option (or click Help in the menu bar), and then click About Internet Explorer. Select the Install new versions automatically checkbox, and then click OK. </p><p id=p1010>Mozilla Firefox: At the top of the Firefox window, click the Help menu and select About Firefox. The About Mozilla Firefox window will open, and Firefox will begin checking for updates. If an update is available, it will begin downloading automatically. </p><p id=p1051>Chrome: Open Google Chrome on your computer. In the top right, click the Chrome menu and select Help > About Google Chrome. The current version number is the series of numbers beneath the "Google Chrome" heading. Chrome will check for updates when you're on this page. Click Relaunch to apply any available update. </p><p id=p1104>Safari: You can keep Safari up to date by keeping OS X up to date. To get the most recent version of Safari, install the latest version of OS X from the Mac App Store and keep an eye out for all available Safari and OS X updates. </p><p id=p1152><span class='token pointer' id='tok-95-34' style='color:red'>Limit Browser ExtensionsBrowser</span>offer users new ways to interact with their browser and to access other features not available through the browser alone and can increase the functionality of a website. </p><p id=p1184>Conclusion: The web is a risky place — there's no getting around that. It's also core to our daily personal and business lives. With just a little effort, however, users can practice safe internet browsing and keep their activities more private from prying eyes.
