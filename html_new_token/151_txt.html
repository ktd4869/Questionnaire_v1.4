<p id=p0>Introduction We have a problem Houston…and its name is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-0' style='color:red'>cybercrime.</span>In 2017, we saw some of the biggest <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-1' style='color:red'>breaches</span>of all time, including the Equifax <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-2' style='color:red'>breach,</span>which left the company reeling from a 38% share price drop, and Verizon, where 14 million customer records were exposed. In the latest Ponemon Institute report, "Cost of Data Breach Study", the average total cost of a breach was $3.62 million per <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-3' style='color:red'>organization.</span>The report also went on to point <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-4' style='color:red'>out</span>the far-reaching impact of a breach, such as the detection and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-5' style='color:red'>remediation</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-6' style='color:red'>costs</span>and time, as well as having to inform customers, with the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-7' style='color:red'>knock-on effects</span>that on business reputation. </p><p id=p108>The Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) for 2017 went into the detail of cybercrime and came out with some interesting information, including that over half of breaches involved <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-8' style='color:red'>malware</span>and 66% of malware was installed from a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-9' style='color:red'>Phishing</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-10' style='color:red'>malicious email attachment.</span>as ever, a popular choice for the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-11' style='color:red'>cybercriminal,</span>with 1 in 14 phished individuals falling for the trick. Phishing is successful because <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-12' style='color:red'>cybercriminals</span>use our own <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-13' style='color:red'>behavior</span>against us in a war of psychology. The report also pointed out that the password issue <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-14' style='color:red'>persists,</span>as 80% of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-15' style='color:red'>hacking</span>is down to stolen or easily guessable passwords. </p><p id=p206>So, how do we <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-16' style='color:red'>stifle</span>the march of the cybercriminal? We have to approach it from a technological perspective but also a human one, too. As stated, cybercriminals feed off our own behavior and use it against us. They trick us into performing actions which seem <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-17' style='color:red'>legitimate,</span>but aren't. It is this aspect that technological solutions cannot resolve and which need to be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-18' style='color:red'>bolstered</span>by drawing in the human behavior aspect. This can be achieved by creating a </p><p id=p286>5 Ways To Create a Security CultureSo, just what is a security culture all about? In a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-19' style='color:red'>nutshell,</span>it is based on the adage "know they enemy". If you know what you are up against, you can put procedures in place to protect yourself. A security culture is one that incorporates everyone who is involved in an organization – this may well extend to business associates, and in some circumstances, customers; certainly, some aspects of a security culture can include customers, for example, educating customers about <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-20' style='color:red'>phishing</span>emails can be seen as part of the overall culture of security your organization develops. A security culture is helped by the use of security <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-21' style='color:red'>awareness</span>training and a positive attitude, driven from the top down, towards <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-22' style='color:red'>embracing</span>security. Below is a list of the top 5 areas that you need to consider when building a culture of security in your organization. </p><p id=p435>Education, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-23' style='color:red'>education,</span>education </p><p id=p438>Knowledge is power, and education on cybercrime and typical attack scenarios is a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-24' style='color:red'>crucial</span>part of any security awareness training program. Security needs to be fostered and fed, and so the ethos of training should be done using a top-down approach. Management needs to be the advocates for the training, themselves taking part in its development as a company <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-25' style='color:red'>policy.</span>The education around security needs to be extended to everyone that could pose a risk to your organization – this includes all staff, contractors, freelancers, consultants, third parties (such as suppliers), and even customers.Your company needs you! </p><p id=p535>Security is everyone's problem. Any one of us can become the weakest link in an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-26' style='color:red'>organization's</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-27' style='color:red'>cybersecurity</span>defenses; the finger that clicks on the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-28' style='color:red'>malware package,</span>person who reveals their password to what seems like a legitimate site. A <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-29' style='color:red'>holistic</span>view needs to be taken where everyone recognizes the part they play in the culture of the company and the impact they personally can have on security. Understanding security issues cuts across the entire organization, from having a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-30' style='color:red'>clean-desk policy</span>to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-31' style='color:red'>developers</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-32' style='color:red'>DevOps</span>understanding the importance of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-33' style='color:red'>secure coding</span></p><p id=p630>Security awareness training and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-34' style='color:red'>simulation</span>exercises give the vital first-hand experience needed to learn and understand where the risks lie. A <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-35' style='color:red'>security bootcamp</span>be created that utilizes a mix of classroom-based formal training, with real-life simulation exercises that train people to spot security problems. Security bootcamps should cover all aspects of security from phishing and online security to desktop security to physical security. Phishing simulation should be done regularly, but also randomly, to create more <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-36' style='color:red'>natural</span>scenarios. People are your best asset, and they can also be one of the greatest security assets too. </p><p id=p725>Security awareness training and the culture it instills are measurable. If you incorporate <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-37' style='color:red'>quizzes</span>and other measurement activities, make them fun and offer rewards for a job well done. Create a system that rewards and encourages security best practices, but conversely, don't use poor outcomes by an individual as punishment. Instead, focus in on how to improve a program – after all, we are all different, and different styles of learning suit different types of people. </p><p id=p801>Employees should feel empowered after receiving the training and knowledge to help play their part in preventing a security breach. A security culture is a state of mind, and if done correctly, can become part of the way of life at an organization, sitting alongside the general day-to-day business. But it should always be remembered that a culture of security is part of an ongoing process. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-38' style='color:red'>Cybercriminals</span>rarely sit on their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-39' style='color:red'>laurels.</span>They develop new and more <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-40' style='color:red'>sophisticated</span>techniques to trick us. All of the elements of a security culture need to be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-41' style='color:red'>cultivated</span>as part of an ongoing process. Training should be regularly repeated, whilst keeping the random aspect of phishing simulations. Becoming security mindful will make the act of security normalized.Security Awareness </p><p id=p925>Making 2018 The Year Of Security CultureIt is likely that 2018 will see as many, if not more, cyber attacks against organizations of all sizes and types. Many of these attacks will begin with the manipulation of our own behavior by the cybercriminal. To address this, we must fight fire with fire, and build defenses using our greatest asset – our people. A culture of security is about addressing insecure behavior and encouraging secure thinking. In doing so, you can build an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-151-42' style='color:red'>encompassing</span>ethos that will protect against some of the most common attack methods like phishing, potentially saving your company money, reputation, and ensuring that compliance requirements are met. </p><p id=p1035>     </p>
