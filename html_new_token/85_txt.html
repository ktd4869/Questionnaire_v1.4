<p id=p0>Internet <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-0' style='color:red'>fraud</span>has been around for just about as long as the Internet itself. Each year, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-1' style='color:red'>cybercriminals</span>come up with new techniques and tactics designed to fool their potential victims. This article will examine different types of fraud and what you can do to protect yourself against them. </p><p id=p48>There is one thing in particular that sets fraud apart from other Internet threats like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-2' style='color:red'>viruses,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-3' style='color:red'>Trojans,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-4' style='color:red'>spyware,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-5' style='color:red'>blockers,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-6' style='color:red'>spam,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-7' style='color:red'>SMS</span>the target of the cybercriminals is not a computer, whose security has to be circumvented, but a human who, as we all know, has his/her own weaknesses. That is why no program can ever provide users with 100% protection; the users themselves have to take a proactive stance in ensuring their own online security. </p><p id=p124>We have already addressed the technical aspects of fraud and typical fraud schemes employed by cybercriminals in a previous article. However, simply knowing how fraud and scams work isn't always enough – this article offers some simple rules that can help users avoid many of the traps on the Internet. </p><p id=p174>Types of fraud </p><p id=p177><span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-8' style='color:red'>Phishing</span></p><p id=p178>Phishing emails include fake notifications from banks, e-payment systems, and email providers, social networks, online games, etc. The aim of these emails is to obtain a user's confidential <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-9' style='color:red'>data</span>(username, password, etc.). Bank <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-10' style='color:red'>phishing</span>is one of the most commonplace tactics aimed at gaining access to your online bank account, or your e-payment account details. Once a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-11' style='color:red'>malicious</span>user gets ahold of your login and password, he has access to your account. </p><p id=p250>Phishers are skilled at creating authentic-looking emails which are disguised as official emails from various organizations. In particular, they use organizations' official logos and copy the overall style of legitimate correspondence. As a rule, the email will suggest that the recipient click on a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-12' style='color:red'>link</span>in order to enter their personal information (usually the suggestion claims that recent measures were allegedly taken by the company's administration to improve website security, and state that the user needs to log in again). When a user clicks on the link, he is taken to a fraudulent website that looks just like the official site where he can enter his username and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-13' style='color:red'>password;</span>the data is then sent to the cybercriminals. Quite often, these fraudulent sites contain exploits that install spyware on a victim computer. So even if you don't enter your username or password and you just click on the link out of curiosity, you may still <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-14' style='color:red'>inadvertently</span>download malware to your computer that could subsequently steal a range of personal data.  </p><p id=p420>How to recognize a phishing email </p><p id=p426>Example 1. You receive an email from a bank, e-payment system, or email provider. If you do not use the services of said bank, e-payment system or email provider, then the email is definitely fraudulent — just delete it. </p><p id=p465>Example 2. You receive an email from a bank, e-payment system, or email provider where you do have an account. In this case, read the text carefully: if the email asks you to enter your login or password, then the email is fraudulent. Legitimate companies and organizations do not ask users to log in in this manner. </p><p id=p522>There is another simple way to tell a fake email from an authentic email: hover the mouse cursor over the link. In the lower left hand of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-15' style='color:red'>browser,</span>you will see the actual URL of the address that you will be taken to if you click on the link. Look at it carefully: the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-85-16' style='color:red'>second-tier domain</span>part of the address that directly precedes the slash) should belong to the organization sending the email. </p><p id=p597>But links like those below and any other links that have something other than "paypal.com" directly before the backslash are fraudulent.  </p><p id=p619>Also beware of emails with attachments. These emails may not only be phishing emails designed to obtain your confidential data, but the attachment itself may be malicious.  </p><p id=p647>If you have any doubts at all, go to the official site yourself. Do not use the link in the email, but enter the official site address manually in your browser. That way, you can guarantee your own security, avoid visiting a fraudulent site, and check out the information you need on the official website.  </p><p id=p703>Bear in mind that scammers aren't only interested in your online bank account or e-payment account. They are interested in any personal information, which is why phishers also target email systems, social networking sites, online games, and really any system that requires a login and password. </p><p id=p749>Phishing: social networks </p><p id=p752>Do you have an account on Facebook, Twitter, Orkut, LinkedIn, or any other popular social network? If so, you already know what their official email notifications look like. </p><p id=p780>However — fake notifications can look almost exactly the same. These fake emails are designed to steal your personal data and gain access to your social network account. The scheme is much like the bank phishing schemes described above: you receive a notification allegedly sent from a social network claiming that someone left you a message or wants to add you as a friend, or that you need to update your account information. You click on a link, but instead of taking you to the official site, you are led to a fraudulent website that looks exactly like the real thing. Then you enter your login and password, which are sent to the scammers, before you are redirected to the official website. </p><p id=p902>Fake social network notifications may not ask you to enter your username or password and the email may look 100% genuine except for the links. Take a very close look at the actual address of the site that you are being led to.  </p><p id=p946>Phishing: online games </p><p id=p949>Even free online games frequently feature certain elements that users may pay money for: special gear, items, an original avatar etc. in addition to other additional bonuses. And where ever there is money, you are sure to find fraud not far behind. The scheme is pretty standard:  trick users into visiting a bogus website. Just like with other types of phishing, the address of the fake site may be very similar to the official website's address. </p><p id=p1026>Only a very detail-oriented user will notice that the domain name of the suggested site contains the extra letter "I" in worlidofwarcraft.com. However, users who are familiar with phishing will immediately recognize the trap: real emails will never ask users to follow a link to enter their password! </p><p id=p1074>In order to attract users' attention, scammers sometimes come up with more clever tactics. You may be asked to be a beta-tester for a new game, or receive an offer for something free — just follow the link! However, if you do, you could fall into their trap and end up on a bogus website, where malicious users will attempt to steal your personal data. You could also end up on an infected site that will download all sorts of malware to your computer. </p><p id=p1158>The best way of protecting yourself — just like with other types of phishing scams — is not to click on any links, and not to enter any personal data. You can always go directly to the official site and bypass any fraudulent links.  </p><p id=p1203>Other types of phishing </p><p id=p1207>There are many different types of phishing — scammers create bogus emails for all kinds of Internet resources that require a username and password. Services like hosting, online magazines, etc. can all be targeted; cybercriminals generally look to copy a well known online resource that is trusted by users.
