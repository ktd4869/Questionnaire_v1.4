<p id=p0>Adobe and Microsoft today each released <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-0' style='color:red'>patches</span>to fix serious <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-1' style='color:red'>security</span>holes in their software. Adobe pushed out a new version of its <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-2' style='color:red'>beleaguered</span>Flash Player <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-3' style='color:red'>browser</span>plugin. Redmond issued updates to address at least 61 distinct <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-4' style='color:red'>vulnerabilities</span>in Microsoft Windows and related programs, including several flaws that were publicly detailed prior to today and one <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-5' style='color:red'>"zero-day"</span>bug in Windows that is already being actively exploited by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-6' style='color:red'>attackers.</span></p><p id=p68>As per usual, the bulk of the fixes from Microsoft tackle security weaknesses in the company's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-7' style='color:red'>Web</span>browsers, Internet Explorer and Edge. Patches also are available for Windows, Office, Sharepoint, and the .NET Framework, among other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-8' style='color:red'>components.</span></p><p id=p105>Of the 61 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-9' style='color:red'>bugs</span>fixed in this patch batch, 17 earned Microsoft's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-10' style='color:red'>"critical"</span>rating, meaning malware or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-11' style='color:red'>miscreants</span>could use them to break into Windows <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-12' style='color:red'>computers</span>with little or no help from users. </p><p id=p138>The zero-day flaw, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-13' style='color:red'>CVE-2018-8440, affects</span>operating systems from Windows 7 through Windows 10 and allows a program launched by a restricted Windows user to gain more powerful administrative access on the system. It was first publicized August 27 in a (now deleted) Twitter post that linked users to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-14' style='color:red'>proof-of-concept</span>code hosted on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-15' style='color:red'>Github.</span>Since then, security experts have spotted versions of the code being used in active attacks. </p><p id=p207>According to security firm <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-16' style='color:red'>Ivanti,</span>prior to today bad guys got advance notice about three vulnerabilities in Windows targeted by these patches. The first, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-17' style='color:red'>CVE-2018-8457,</span>is a critical memory corruption issue that could be exploited through a malicious Web site or Office file. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-18' style='color:red'>CVE-2018-8475</span>is a critical bug in most supported versions of Windows that can be used for nasty purposes by getting a user to view a specially crafted image file. The third previously <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-19' style='color:red'>disclosed</span>flaw, CVE-2018-8409, is a somewhat less severe <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-20' style='color:red'>"denial-of-service"</span>vulnerability. </p><p id=p292>Standard advice about Windows <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-21' style='color:red'>patches: Not</span>infrequently, Redmond ships updates that end up causing stability issues for some users, and it doesn't hurt to wait a day or two before seeing if any major problems are reported with new updates before installing them. Windows 10 likes to install patches and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-22' style='color:red'>reboot</span>your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-23' style='color:red'>computer</span>on its own schedule, and Microsoft doesn't make it easy for Windows 10 users to change this setting, but it is possible. For all other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-24' style='color:red'>Windows OS</span>if you'd rather be alerted to new updates when they're available so you can choose when to install them, there's a setting for that in Windows Update. </p><p id=p399>It's a good idea to get in the habit of backing up your computer before applying monthly updates from Microsoft. Windows has some built-in tools that can help recover from bad patches, but restoring the system to a backup image taken just before installing updates is often much less hassle and an added peace of mind while you're sitting there praying for the machine to reboot successfully after <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-25' style='color:red'>patching.</span></p><p id=p468>The sole non-Microsoft update pushed by Redmond today fixes a single vulnerability in Adobe Flash <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-26' style='color:red'>Player, CVE-2018-15967.</span>Adobe lists the severity of this information disclosure bug as "important," while Microsoft considers it a more dangerous "critical" flaw. </p><p id=p506>Regardless, if you have Adobe Flash Player installed, it's time to either update your browser and/or operating system, or else disable this problematic and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-27' style='color:red'>insecure</span>plugin. Windows Update should install the Flash Patch for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-28' style='color:red'>IE/Edge</span>users; the newest version of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-29' style='color:red'>Google</span>Chrome, which bundles Flash but prompts users to run Flash elements on a Web page by default, also includes the fix (although a complete Chrome shutdown and restart may be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-30' style='color:red'>necessary</span>before the fix is in). </p><p id=p583>Loyal readers here know full well where I stand on Flash: This is a dangerous, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-31' style='color:red'>oft-exploited</span>program that needs to be relegated to the dustbin of Internet history (for its part, Adobe has said it plans to retire Flash Player in 2020). Fortunately, disabling Flash in Chrome is simple enough. Paste <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-32' style='color:red'>"chrome://settings/content"</span>into a Chrome browser bar and then <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-33' style='color:red'>select "Flash"</span>the list of items. </p><p id=p647>By default, Mozilla Firefox on Windows computers with Flash installed runs Flash in a "protected mode," which prompts the user to decide if they want to enable the plugin before Flash content runs on a Web site. </p><p id=p682>Administrators have the ability to change Flash Player's behavior when running Internet Explorer on Windows 7 by prompting the user before playing Flash content. A guide on how to do that is here (PDF). Administrators may also consider <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-34' style='color:red'>implementing Protected</span>View for Office. Protected View opens a file marked as potentially unsafe in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-35' style='color:red'>Read-only</span>mode. </p><p id=p731>As always, please feel free to leave a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-45-36' style='color:red'>note</span>in the comments below if you experience any issues installing these fixes. Happy patching!
