Normally, the bank would be open on a Monday, but that particular Monday was <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-18' style='color:red'>Memorial Day,</span>federal holiday in the United States. The hackers used hundreds of ATMs across North America to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-19' style='color:red'>dispense</span>funds from customer accounts. All told, the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-20' style='color:red'>perpetrators</span>stole more than $569,000 in that incident. </p><p id=p255>Following the 2016 breach, National Bank hired <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-21' style='color:red'>cybersecurity forensics firm Foregenix</span>investigate.

As with the first incident, the intruders executed their heist on a weekend.

The lawsuit notes the company determined that it was likely the same group of attackers responsible for both intrusions.

The first was a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-32' style='color:red'>"computer and electronic crime"</span>rider that had a single loss limit <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-33' style='color:red'>liability</span>of $8 million, with a $125,000 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-34' style='color:red'>deductible.</span></p><p id=p650>The second was a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-35' style='color:red'>"debit card rider"</span>provided coverage for losses which result directly from the use of lost, stolen or altered debit cards or counterfeit cards.

"Take the example of a car <span class='token pointer' id='tok-135-44' style='color:red'>crash</span>victim whose master cylinder in the vehicle ran out of fluid and as a result the driver ran a red light and hit another car.
