According to the 2015 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-27' style='color:red'>Global</span>Risk Management Survey, 84% of cyber-attacks today target the application layer and not network layer, requiring a more holistic approach to cyber security.  </p><p id=p206>This "wider and deeper" attack surface only adds to the existing problem of how to manage the volume, velocity, and complexity of data generated by the myriad of IT and security tools in an organization's network. The feeds from these disconnected systems must be analyzed, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-28' style='color:red'>normalized,</span>and remediation efforts prioritized. The more tools, the more difficult the challenge. And the broader the attack surface, the more data to analyze. This approach requires legions of staff to comb through the huge amount of data to connect the dots and find latent threats.

For most organizations, the prospects of hiring the staff needed to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-32' style='color:red'>aggregate,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-33' style='color:red'>normalize,</span>and analyze the vast amount of data needed to assess cyber risk exposures are slim.  </p><p id=p371> Breaking down existing silos and automating traditional security operations tasks with the help of technology has therefore become a force-multiplier for supplementing scarce cyber security operations talent.  </p><p id=p400> To successfully operationalize cyber security practices, progressive organizations are turning to new emerging technology that serves as an aggregation and orchestration layer that sits on top of their existing IT and security tools, and assists in the Identification, Prioritization, and Orchestration of Remediation of cyber risks.  </p><p id=p448> Let's take a deeper look at each of these three pillars:  </p><p id=p461>Identification  </p><p id=p463>In order to understand what remediation actions are needed to minimize an organization's cyber risk exposure, identification is the first step. With many organizations overwhelmed with the volume, velocity, and complexity of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-34' style='color:red'>internal security data,</span>has become crucial to streamline the identification process. This step has become the Achilles heel of day-to-day security operations for many companies.  </p><p id=p522> The use of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-35' style='color:red'>human-interactive machine learning engines</span>automate the aggregation of data across different data types; map assessment data to compliance requirements; and normalize the information to rule out false-positives, duplicates, and enrich data attributes.  </p><p id=p560>Prioritization  </p><p id=p562>In the past, the majority of organizations primarily focused on their internal security posture when it comes to cyber security and therefore had a difficult time prioritizing their remediation actions based on business criticality. By leveraging emerging technology, organizations can place internal security intelligence, external threat data, and business criticality into context to derive a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-36' style='color:red'>holistic view</span>risk posture across <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-37' style='color:red'>networks,</span>applications, mobile devices, etc. In this way, security teams can determine what imminent threats they face from cyber adversaries, and which ones present the highest threat to the business.  </p><p id=p654>Orchestration of Remediation  </p><p id=p658>Increasing collaboration between security teams which are responsible for identifying <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-38' style='color:red'>security gaps</span>IT operations teams which are focused on remediating them, continues to be a challenge for many organizations. Using the cyber risk management concept as a blueprint, it's possible to implement automated processes for pro-active security incident notification and human-interactive loop intervention. By establishing thresholds and pre-defined rules, organizations can also orchestrate remediation actions to fix security gaps. Meanwhile, cyber risk management provides a way to measure the effectiveness of remediation actions and ensure risks have been successfully eliminated.  </p><p id=p750>To increase remediation effectiveness, emerging cyber risk management tools also provide playbooks that include step-by-step instructions on how to tackle the most <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-39' style='color:red'>critical vulnerabilities.</span>intelligence-driven cyber risk management model also mandates a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-170-40' style='color:red'>closed-loop</span>remediation process, which assures that a ticket is only closed once the effectiveness of a patch has been revalidated. Unfortunately, many organizations close out tickets as soon as a patch is applied without testing whether it actually fixed the problem. This leaves them vulnerable to a big blind spot if the patch failed.  </p><p id=p838>By implementing these three main pillars, organizations can operationalize their cyber security practices to shorten time-to-detection and ultimately, time-to-remediation of cyber threats. </p><p id=p860>TweetTorsten George is currently a security evangelist at Centrify.
