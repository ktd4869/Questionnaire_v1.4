"This is probably due to the fact that those activities haven't been destructive in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-193-32' style='color:red'>nature…[GreyEnergy's</span>activities are] quite possibly in preparation of future <span class='token pointer' id='tok-193-33' style='color:red'>cyber-sabotage attacks</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-193-34' style='color:red'>laying</span>the groundwork for an operation run by some other APT group." </p><p id=p340>ESET has linked GreyEnergy and BlackEnergy together thanks to strong architectural similarities in their malware, the analysts added.
