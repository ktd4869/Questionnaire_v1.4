However, there was a failure in the final <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-12' style='color:red'>QA validation step</span>the software, and as a result someone from Cisco forgot to remove the code before release. </p><p id=p139>"The presence of the sample, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-13' style='color:red'>dormant</span>exploit code does not represent nor allow an exploitable vulnerability on the product, nor does it present a risk to the product itself as all of the required patches for this vulnerability have been integrated into all shipping software images," Cisco wrote in its advisory. </p><p id=p190>The blunder was discovered during internal security testing. </p><p id=p198>"A failure in the final QA validation step of the automated software build system for the Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) software inadvertently allowed a set of sample, dormant exploit code used <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-14' style='color:red'>internally</span>by Cisco in validation scripts to be included in shipping software images," the company said in an advisory. "This includes an exploit for the Dirty <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-15' style='color:red'>CoW</span>vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195). The purpose of this QA validation step is to make sure the Cisco product contains the required fixes for this vulnerability." </p><p id=p284>Cisco said that it is not aware of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-16' style='color:red'>"malicious</span>use of the issue" and that the issue does not open the impacted software (Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server image versions X8.9 through X8.11.3) to any sort of attack. "The impacted software images will be removed and will be replaced by fixed images," the company said. It did not specify when. </p><p id=p348>Dirty Cow was <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-17' style='color:red'>patched</span>in 2016 after it was discovered in public exploits. The vulnerability was found in the copy-on-write (COW) feature in Linux and could be used by an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-18' style='color:red'>attacker</span>with local access to obtain root privileges on a Linux or Android device. </p><p id=p392>Cisco <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-19' style='color:red'>Patches Critical Bug</span>Small Business <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-20' style='color:red'>Switches </span></p><p id=p400>Cisco, on Wednesday, also disclosed 15 flaws in various products, including three critical vulnerabilities. One of these critical <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-21' style='color:red'>bugs</span>(CVE-2018-15439) was identified in the software used in Cisco's Small Business Switches which are typically deployed in small office network environments. The Small Business switch flaw could enable an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-22' style='color:red'>unauthenticated</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-23' style='color:red'>remote</span>attacker to bypass <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-24' style='color:red'>user</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-25' style='color:red'>authentication</span>in a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-26' style='color:red'>backdoor-ed</span>account. </p><p id=p458>Cisco said it has not released software updates that address this vulnerability, but the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-27' style='color:red'>glitch</span>can be fixed by a simple <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-28' style='color:red'>workaround.</span>The company said that it is not aware of any exploits of this particular vulnerability in the wild. </p><p id=p497>The Cisco Small Business Switch vulnerability exists because when no <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-29' style='color:red'>accounts</span>in the system have top-level access <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-30' style='color:red'>privilege</span>(level 15), the affected software automatically enables a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-31' style='color:red'>default privileged user account</span>has these top privileges – without notifying the </p><p id=p538>"The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-32' style='color:red'>default configuration</span>the devices listed as vulnerable includes a default, privileged user account that is used for the initial <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-33' style='color:red'>login</span>and cannot be removed from the system," the company said in the advisory. "An <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-34' style='color:red'>administrator</span>may disable this account by configuring other user accounts with access privilege set to level 15. However, if all <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-35' style='color:red'>user-configured</span>privilege level 15 accounts are removed from the device configuration, an affected software release re-enables the default privileged user account without notifying administrators of the system." </p><p id=p620>Under these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-36' style='color:red'>circumstances,</span>an attacker could exploit the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-37' style='color:red'>bug</span>by using the default account to log in to an affected device and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-38' style='color:red'>execute</span>commands with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-39' style='color:red'>full admin rights,</span>said in its advisory. </p><p id=p653>The unauthorized privilege access vulnerability, CVE-2018-15439, has a CVSS severity score of 9.8 (out of 10).

"By adding this user account, the default privileged account will be disabled." </p><p id=p834>More Critical <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-41' style='color:red'>Vulnerabilities</span></p><p id=p837>Another critical authentication vulnerability (CVE-2018-15394) exists in Cisco's Stealthwatch Management Console in its Stealthwatch Enterprise platform. The flaw could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-42' style='color:red'>arbitrary</span>actions with administrative privileges on impacted systems. </p><p id=p871>"The vulnerability is due to an insecure system configuration," according the advisory. "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted application. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated access, resulting in elevated privileges in the SMC." </p><p id=p916>The vulnerability, has a CVSS score of 9.8, affects Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise releases 6.10.2 and prior. A patch has been released by Cisco and users can update to Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise Release 6.10.3. </p><p id=p949>Cisco also reported a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-43' style='color:red'>deserialization</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-44' style='color:red'>Java</span>in Cisco Unity Express (CUE) that could enable an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-45' style='color:red'>shell commands</span>the privileges of the root user. </p><p id=p980>"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious <span class='token pointer' id='tok-51-46' style='color:red'>serialized Java object</span>the listening Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service," according to Cisco's advisory.
