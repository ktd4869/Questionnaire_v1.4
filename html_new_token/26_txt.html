For this research, we are using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-26-35' style='color:red'>USRP</span>N200 from Ettus Research. But as we proceed using OpenBTS with USRP N200, we realize that there is an anomaly in the signal transmitted by USRP N200. So, we are using a spectrum analyzer to figure out and find a solution for the signal anomaly.
