Companies will only be allowed to store and process personal data when an individual consents, and cannot hold it for longer than is necessary. The information must be portable from one company to another and must be erased upon request.

The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-155-20' style='color:red'>legislation</span>heavily changes the way customers' personal data is stored, processed and protected, but it doesn't define what a reasonable level of protection truly is.

Finding out what data you have, where you have it and why you have it will be essential to addressing how long information must be kept and the processes used to delete it. For example, patient information is required to be stored for a different amount of time than financial data. InformationWeek contributor Martin James noted that a database solution will help provide a single view of your data, providing full visibility. This type of system can also be used to schedule data deletion and identify any unusual activity. </p><p id=p785>Leaders will also need to rework consent and disclosure forms for business customers.
