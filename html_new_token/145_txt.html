While the increase itself is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-6' style='color:red'>nothing</span>new (there has been more <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-7' style='color:red'>e-commerce</span>fraud every year since 1993), the rate is impressive. The number of fraud cases has increased by 19 percent compared to 2013, and this is the fourth successive time that fraud growth has exceeded e-commerce growth.

"Alternative" payment methods are also attracting criminals. So what does this fraud look like, exactly? A study asked 274 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-21' style='color:red'>merchants</span>from various industries in six countries precisely this question. The most common types of fraud are explained below. </p><p id=p199>Identity Theft </p><p id=p201>According to the study, the most common types of fraud causing concern among merchants are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-22' style='color:red'>identity theft (71</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-23' style='color:red'>phishing</span>(66 percent) and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-24' style='color:red'>account theft</span>percent). Here, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-25' style='color:red'>cards</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-26' style='color:red'>credit</span>the most popular target, as a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-27' style='color:red'>fraudster</span>does not need much to carry out a "card not present" <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-28' style='color:red'>transaction.</span></p><p id=p251>In traditional <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-29' style='color:red'>identity theft,</span>criminals' goal is to carry out <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-30' style='color:red'>transactions</span>using a different <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-31' style='color:red'>identity.</span>Instead of having to come up with a completely new identity to do this, they simply take over an existing one. This is easier to do—and usually much faster. </p><p id=p296>In order to commit identity theft or appropriate someone's identity, fraudsters target personal information, such as names, addresses and email addresses, as well as credit card or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-32' style='color:red'>account</span>information. This enables them, for example, to order items online under a false name and pay using someone else's credit card information or by debiting another person's account. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-33' style='color:red'>Phishing,</span>on the other hand, simply involves using fraudulent websites, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-34' style='color:red'>emails or text messages</span>access personal data. Another technical method is known as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-35' style='color:red'>pharming,</span>in which <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-36' style='color:red'>manipulated browsers</span>unsuspecting customers to fraudulent websites. Often, all that is required to appropriate someone's identity is a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-37' style='color:red'>stolen password.</span>can be used to take over an existing account with an online shop – in most cases, the payment data is already stored in the account. </p><p id=p427>Of course, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-38' style='color:red'>hacker</span>attacks on e-commerce providers and stealing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-39' style='color:red'>customer data</span>fall under this fraud category, as does using malware on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-40' style='color:red'>computers</span>to commit identity theft by spying out sensitive data. "Man-in-the-middle attacks" are even more sophisticated. These involve hackers muscling in on communications between customers and merchants (or between customers and banks) in order to siphon off login data. </p><p id=p488>We haven't even mentioned the opportunities involved in intercepting credit cards sent by mail, for example, or in copying credit cards in restaurants and hotels or at <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-41' style='color:red'>cash</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-42' style='color:red'>machines.</span>Already, though, the true extent of the identity theft problem is apparent. </p><p id=p529>Friendly Fraud </p><p id=p531>In fourth place is what the merchants surveyed refer to as "friendly fraud". This sounds friendlier than it really is: using this method, customers order goods or services and pay for them – preferably using a "pull" payment method like a credit card or direct debit. Then, however, they deliberately initiate a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-43' style='color:red'>chargeback,</span>claiming that their credit card or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-44' style='color:red'>account details</span>stolen. They are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-45' style='color:red'>reimbursed—but</span>they keep the goods or services. This fraud method is particularly prevalent with services, such as those in the gambling or adult <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-46' style='color:red'>milieus.</span>Friendly fraud also tends to be combined with re-shipping. This is where criminals who use stolen <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-47' style='color:red'>payment data to</span>for their purchases don't want to have them sent to their home addresses. Instead, they use <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-48' style='color:red'>middlemen</span>whose details are used to make the purchases and who then forward the goods. </p><p id=p671>Clean Fraud </p><p id=p673>Clean <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-49' style='color:red'>fraud's</span>name is misleading, because there's nothing clean about it. The basic principle of clean fraud is that a stolen credit card is used to make a purchase, but the transaction is then manipulated in such a way that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-50' style='color:red'>fraud detection</span>are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-51' style='color:red'>circumvented.</span>Much more know-how is required here than with friendly fraud, where the only goal is to cancel the payment once a purchase has been made. In clean fraud, criminals use sound <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-52' style='color:red'>analyses</span>of the fraud detection systems <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-53' style='color:red'>deployed,</span>plus a great deal of knowledge about the rightful owners of their stolen credit cards. A great deal of correct information is then entered during the payment process so that the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-54' style='color:red'>fraud detection solution</span>fooled. Before clean fraud is committed, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-55' style='color:red'>card testing</span>often carried out. This involves making cheap <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-56' style='color:red'>test purchases</span>to check that the stolen <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-57' style='color:red'>credit card data</span></p><p id=p819>Affiliate Fraud </p><p id=p821>There are two variations of affiliate fraud, both of which have the same aim: to glean more money from an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-58' style='color:red'>affiliate program</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-59' style='color:red'>manipulating traffic</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-60' style='color:red'>signup statistics.</span>can be done either using a fully <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-61' style='color:red'>automated process</span>by getting real people to log into merchants' sites using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-62' style='color:red'>fake</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-63' style='color:red'>accounts.</span>This type of fraud is payment-method-neutral, but extremely widely distributed. </p><p id=p882></p><p id=p884>During <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-64' style='color:red'>triangulation</span>fraud, the fraud is carried out via three points. The first is a fake online <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-65' style='color:red'>storefront,</span>which offers high-demand goods at extremely low prices. In most cases, additional bait is added, like the information that the goods will only be shipped immediately if the goods are paid for using a credit card. The falsified shop collects address and credit card data – this is its only purpose. The second corner of the fraud triangle involves using other stolen credit card data and the name collected to order goods at a real store and ship them to the original customer. The third point in the fraud triangle involves using the stolen credit card data to make additional purchases. The order data and credit card numbers are now almost impossible to connect, so the fraud usually remains undiscovered for a longer period of time, resulting in greater damages. </p><p id=p1032><span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-66' style='color:red'>Merchant</span>Fraud </p><p id=p1034>Merchant fraud is another method which must be mentioned. It's very simple: goods are offered at cheap prices, but are never shipped. The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-67' style='color:red'>payments</span>are, of course, kept. This method of fraud also exists in wholesale. It is not specific to any particular payment method, but this is, of course, where <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-68' style='color:red'>no-chargeback</span>payment methods (most of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-145-69' style='color:red'>push payment types)</span>into their own.  </p><p id=p1098>More International Fraud </p><p id=p1101>On average, the merchants who participated in the study do business in 14 countries.
