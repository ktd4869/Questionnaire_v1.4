During their initial research, the researchers discovered that Android, Linux, Apple, Windows, OpenBSD, MediaTek, Linksys, and others, are all affected by the KRACK attacks. </p><p id=p211>It should be noted that the KRACK attack does not help attackers recover the targeted WiFi's password; instead, it allows them to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-32-9' style='color:red'>decrypt</span>WiFi users' data without cracking or knowing the actual password. </p><p id=p244>So merely changing your Wi-Fi network password does not prevent (or mitigate) KRACK attack. </p><p id=p258>Here's How the KRACK WPA2 Attack Works (PoC Code): </p><p id=p267>Discovered by researcher Mathy Vanhoef of imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven, the KRACK attack works by exploiting a 4-way <span class='token pointer' id='tok-32-10' style='color:red'>handshake</span>of the WPA2 protocol that's used to establish a key for encrypting traffic. </p><p id=p298>For a successful KRACK attack, an attacker needs to trick a victim into re-installing an already-in-use key, which is achieved by manipulating and replaying cryptographic handshake messages. </p><p id=p325>"When the victim reinstalls the key, associated parameters such as the incremental transmit packet number (i.e. nonce) and receive packet number (i.e. replay counter) are reset to their initial value," the researcher writes. "Essentially, to guarantee security, a key should only be installed and used once. Unfortunately, we found this is not guaranteed by the WPA2 protocol. By manipulating cryptographic handshakes, we can abuse this weakness in practice."The research [PDF], titled Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2, has been published by Mathy Vanhoef of KU Leuven and Frank Piessens of imec-DistriNet, Nitesh Saxena and Maliheh Shirvanian of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Yong Li of Huawei Technologies, and Sven Schäge of Ruhr-Universität Bochum. </p><p id=p440>The team has successfully executed the key reinstallation attack against an Android smartphone, showing how an attacker can decrypt all data that the victim transmits over a protected WiFi. You can watch the video demonstration above and download proof-of-concept (PoC) code from Github. </p><p id=p481>"Decryption of packets is possible because a key reinstallation attack causes the transmit nonces (sometimes also called packet numbers or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-32-11' style='color:red'>initialization</span>vectors) to be reset to zero.
