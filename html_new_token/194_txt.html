Since then, police have taken down another botnet, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-21' style='color:red'>NgrBot</span>(aka <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-22' style='color:red'>Dorkbot),</span>as well. </p><p id=p143>In cases where law enforcement <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-23' style='color:red'>intervened</span>to take down the servers and future communication domain rendezvous of banking Trojan operations, gangs did not appear to recover. This is possibly because they wanted to escape attention from law enforcement and potential legal consequences. </p><p id=p185>While spam botnets have been known to come back from the dead, banking Trojan botnets never have. Until September this year, takedown operations targeting major financial <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-24' style='color:red'>malware</span>were widely considered the death of the operation, making the gang behind it lose touch with all its money-making <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-25' style='color:red'>zombies.</span></p><p id=p232>According to IBM <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-26' style='color:red'>X-Force</span>researchers, that may have officially changed in December 2015. Not even a year after Ramnit was taken down, we are seeing what appears to be the first real re-emergence of the banking Trojan botnet. The conclusion comes from IBM X-Force malware researchers, who have found a new variant of the Ramnit banking Trojan and botnet. Both are already active in attacks on banks and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-27' style='color:red'>e-commerce</span>transactions in Canada, Australia, the U.S. and Finland. </p><p id=p309>The Ramnit botnet is communicating with new attack servers, employs a completely new and much shorter <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-28' style='color:red'>configuration</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-29' style='color:red'>file</span>and uses a revamped <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-30' style='color:red'>webinjection</span>scheme against its infected victims. </p><p id=p337>Learn why global threat intelligence is more important than ever in the fight against web <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-31' style='color:red'>fraud</span> </p><p id=p354><span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-32' style='color:red'>Ramnit's</span>Past LifeWhen Ramnit was first discovered in the wild in 2010, it was only the name of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-33' style='color:red'>worm</span>used as an infection <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-34' style='color:red'>vector</span>that leveraged the use of removable drives and network shares to spread to new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-35' style='color:red'>endpoints.</span>In 2011, Ramnit's developer took up the task of dressing this virus with code chunks borrowed from the leaked Zeus <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-36' style='color:red'>Trojan</span>sources and turned it into a banking Trojan. </p><p id=p423>Within three years, the Ramnit Trojan gained quite a bit of momentum in its cybercrime operations. In its pre-takedown life, Ramnit was one of the top banking <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-37' style='color:red'>Trojans</span>in the cybercrime arena, ranking fourth on the most active banking Trojan list in 2014, right under <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-38' style='color:red'>Neverquest</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-39' style='color:red'>(Vawtrak)</span>and alongside other major gangs such as Shylock, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-40' style='color:red'>Dyre</span>and the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-41' style='color:red'>Bugat</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-42' style='color:red'>(Dridex)</span>bunch. </p><p id=p484>At the time, Ramnit primarily attacked in the U.K., U.S. and Australia. The Trojan sported a hefty configuration file replete with URL triggers that told it which banks, online transactions and social networking sites to harvest credentials from. In addition to its wanted list, Ramnit used its configuration to steer victims away from a rather exhaustive list of online <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-43' style='color:red'>anti-malware</span>scans, antivirus websites, cybercrime information sites and security blogs. In its old configuration, the mere use of the words "cybercrime" or "police" on a victim's part triggered a </p><p id=p574>Another very visible part of Ramnit's previous configurations was the massive amount of job recruitment sites it targeted, harvesting user credentials from the sites in order to target those looking for a job and recruit them. For the victims, this would be a double-edged sword since Ramnit's operators could also obtain all the information they put on their professional CV. </p><p id=p634>It was pretty clear that the gang behind this Trojan intended to recruit as many <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-44' style='color:red'>mules</span>as possible in each targeted country. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-45' style='color:red'>Mules</span>are central to the cash-out chain of stolen funds; oftentimes, gangs will also rent out their network of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-46' style='color:red'>money mules</span>other cybercriminals in need. </p><p id=p682>Back in BusinessUp to this point, Ramnit was believed to be owned by one cybercrime gang and exclusively operated by one team. According to IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, Ramnit's source code was never openly sold or shared with other cybercriminals and it was not part of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-47' style='color:red'>underground chatter.</span>what we've learned so far, nothing seems to point to a notable change in terms of who is behind Ramnit. It is possible that a new gang has picked the project up, but attribution remains vague in this case. </p><p id=p770>The new Ramnit variants discovered by IBM X-Force are identical to the previous ones in terms of their source code and behavior patterns. The only change in modus operandi is expressed in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-48' style='color:red'>webinjections</span>and the configuration file, which are both considered to be moving parts in the inner workings of any banking Trojan. Recent findings from IBM X-Force indicated that a number of other Trojans, like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-49' style='color:red'>Shifu,</span>Dridex and Neverquest, have been using the exact same webinjections and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-50' style='color:red'>remote servers,</span>can be indicative of gangs purchasing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-51' style='color:red'>software-as-a-service</span>(SaaS) from the same <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-52' style='color:red'>injection</span>developers. </p><p id=p865>Strangely enough, Ramnit's old configuration server is still up, sending configuration files into thin air without any <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-53' style='color:red'>bots</span>on the other end. </p><p id=p887>The new server commands newly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-54' style='color:red'>infected machines</span>are receiving Ramnit through the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-55' style='color:red'>exploit</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-56' style='color:red'>kit.</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-57' style='color:red'>Angler</span>regularly updates them with configurations and executable file builds. The new Ramnit also operates with a real-time <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-58' style='color:red'>webinjection server,</span>pulling attack schemes on the fly when infected users browse to a few major banks in Canada. </p><p id=p941>What's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-59' style='color:red'>Next?Ramnit</span>has been known to mostly spread itself via <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-60' style='color:red'>malvertising</span>campaigns that lead users to an exploit kit. At this time, it is believed to be using the Angler EK, but this is probably not the only infection tactic. Ramnit's operators have varied their propagation campaigns in the past and may be launching them in additional forms, such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-194-61' style='color:red'>poisoned macros,</span>attachments and the usual worm behavior typical to this malware. </p><p id=p1014>At the time of this writing, Ramnit attacked major banks in Canada, Australia, the U.S. and Finland.
