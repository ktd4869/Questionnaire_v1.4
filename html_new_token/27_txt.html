<p id=p0>What's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-0' style='color:red'>RFID?</span>RFID stands for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-1' style='color:red'>Radio Frequency Identification.</span>is a technology allowing devices to automatically identify information stored in a tag through <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-2' style='color:red'>radio</span>waves. An RFID tag consists of an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-3' style='color:red'>antenna</span>and a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-4' style='color:red'>microchip</span>in order to transmit and receive. </p><p id=p41>This technology is generally characterized by the use of three important and essential components: the chip, the antenna and the reader. </p><p id=p62>The Evolution of RFIDThe use of RFID goes back to World War II, where it was used as a form of radar to locate Allied planes. Below is a quick history of the evolution of this technology. </p><p id=p99>Date Historical fact 1940 The concept of RFID is used for the first time to identify and authenticate aircraft in flight (IFF: Identify Friendly Foe). It is done to allow the identification of allied planes. 1970 From 1960-1970, RFID systems are kept as a confidential technology for military use to control access to sensitive sites, especially nuclear ones. But it seems that some companies have used it as well. 1980 Technological advances allow the appearance of the passive tag. The retro RFID tag modulates the wave radiated by the interrogator to transmit information. This technology eliminates the energy source embedded on the label, reducing its cost and maintenance. 1990 RFID technology begins to be normalized, allowing it to work with other systems.1999The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) founds the Auto-ID center. This is a research center specialized in automatic identification.2003 The MIT center becomes EPCGlobal, an organization that promotes the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-5' style='color:red'>Electronic Product Code</span>extending the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-6' style='color:red'>barcode</span>to RFID. Starting 2005 RFID technologies are now widely used in almost all industrial sectors (aeronautics, automotive, logistics, transportation, health, daily life). The ISO (International Standard Organization) has largely contributed to the implementation of several standards (both technical and applied) to achieve a degree of interoperability. 2009 Creation of the National RFID Reference Center. How Does It Work? The operating principle of RFID systems is based on the remote exchange of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-7' style='color:red'>electromagnetic waves.</span>the reader transmits a signal at a given frequency to one or more radio tags located in its reading field and they also transmit a signal back. The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-8' style='color:red'>electromagnetic field feeds</span>label and activates the chip. </p><p id=p367>To transmit the information recorded in the chip, the chip creates an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-9' style='color:red'>amplitude or phase modulation</span>the carrier frequency. Once this information is received by the reader, it transforms it into <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-10' style='color:red'>binary code.</span>operation remains symmetrical in the opposite direction. </p><p id=p409>The scenario of a radio frequency identification is therefore as follows: </p><p id=p420>The reader transmits energy by radio to activate the tag. </p><p id=p430>It queries the tags nearby. </p><p id=p435>It listens to the answers and eliminates duplicates or collisions between answers. </p><p id=p447>Finally, it transmits the results obtained to the concerned applications. </p><p id=p457>RFID Labels/Tags. These little devices are commonly called labels, but they are found under other names (smart labels, smart tags, tags, transponders). They are equipment intended to receive a radio signal and to immediately return a different radio signal containing relevant information. Each tag consists of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-11' style='color:red'>microcircuit</span>and an antenna. </p><p id=p508>Just like the barcode that's read with an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-12' style='color:red'>optical laser,</span>RFID tag is also scanned with a reader that retrieves radio frequency signals emitted by this tag. </p><p id=p536>There are three types of tags: </p><p id=p542>Passive tags: Devices that do not require any source of power, except that provided by readers at the time of the scan.Active tags: Devices equipped with a battery, allowing them to communicate with the readers. Unlike passive tags, active tags can be read from long distances.Semi-active tags: They act as a passive tag for communication and use their battery only to record the data. </p><p id=p606>The principal characteristics of a tag are: </p><p id=p613>Large <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-13' style='color:red'>storage capacity</span>or more <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-14' style='color:red'>kilobytes)Can</span>be read by a scanner at a distance that can range from a few centimeters to about 200 metersCan be read but not necessarily written. It is, however, possible to rewrite the tag and thus recycle itEase of useStandardsThe RFID system is based on a frequency system and has several tag devices, each adapted to the frequencies that suit it. The below protocols define the functionality provided by different types of tags. </p><p id=p692><span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-15' style='color:red'>Ethical Hacking Training</span>Resources (InfoSec) </p><p id=p698>RFID Frequency BandsA radio signal has a radius of a few hundred meters, depending on the power of the installation and the frequency used. A radio wave is classified according to its frequency expressed in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-16' style='color:red'>Hertz (Hz)</span>cycles per second. </p><p id=p739>The set of frequencies used for RFID technology is described below. </p><p id=p750>Low FrequencyThese are the frequencies ranging from 30 to 300KHz, with a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-27-17' style='color:red'>wavelength</span>of 1 to 10 km and a reading distance going up to 10cm. </p><p id=p776>In RFID, a tag using low frequency is represented by the acronym LF (Low Frequency).
