<p id=p0>Which <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-0' style='color:red'>web</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-1' style='color:red'>resources</span>most often attract <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-2' style='color:red'>cybercriminals?</span>It's always those where they can reach the greatest number of users and deliver the maximum possible profits. Today, practically all internet users have an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-3' style='color:red'>account</span>with a social <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-4' style='color:red'>network</span>(and often several with different networks), which makes these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-5' style='color:red'>sites</span>very popular with cybercriminals. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-6' style='color:red'>Facebook</span>is the most attractive social network: according to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-7' style='color:red'>Kaspersky</span>Lab's statistics, fake sites imitating Facebook accounted for nearly 22% of all instances when the heuristic <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-8' style='color:red'>Anti-phishing</span>component was <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-9' style='color:red'>triggered.</span></p><p id=p81>A useful account </p><p id=p84>On the face of it, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-10' style='color:red'>hijacking</span>social network accounts shouldn't be that attractive for cybercriminals, as it doesn't bring an immediate profit – we don't keep our savings with Facebook, while the personal <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-11' style='color:red'>information</span>placed on these networks is only interesting to our friends and loved ones. But that first impression may be misleading. In reality, there may be several reasons for cybercriminals to want illegitimate access to the accounts in Facebook or any other social network: </p><p id=p161>To spread <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-12' style='color:red'>phishing</span>links. For phishing purposes, it is more effective to use real <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-13' style='color:red'>hijacked</span>accounts rather than to create <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-14' style='color:red'>ad-hoc</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-15' style='color:red'>bot</span>accounts. It is much more likely that a person will click on a fake bank site if the link comes from his/her social network friend rather than from an unknown person.To spread <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-16' style='color:red'>malware.</span>Just like with phishing links, social network users more readily download and open files coming from their Facebook friends.To send spam to the victim's contact list and publish spam on the friends' walls where it can be seen by other users.To practice fraud, such as extorting money from the hijacked <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-17' style='color:red'>account's</span>friends. The fraudster can send messages asking people to send money for help. To collect information on specific people. Such information can be later used to launch targeted attacks, such as targeted phishing. To sell hijacked accounts. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-18' style='color:red'>Cybercriminals</span>sell hijacked accounts to other cybercriminals who in turn use them to spread spam, phishing links or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-19' style='color:red'>malware.Hijackers</span>most often use the last option on this list, making money by selling stolen <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-20' style='color:red'>data.</span></p><p id=p338>Bait </p><p id=p339>How do users land on fake <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-21' style='color:red'>webpages?</span>Cybercriminals have created a number of ways to entice their victims to pages with phishing content. They typically use one of the following to send links to phishing webpages: </p><p id=p375>Letters imitating notification messages from a social network. These messages are sent from dedicated <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-22' style='color:red'>email</span>accounts.Letters sent from compromised email accounts to associated address lists. This can be a message sent to friends, inviting them to follow a link to look at something interesting.Messages in social networks sent from ad-hoc fake accounts or from hijacked accounts.In forum messages.In search engine results.In banners with attractive pictures or in banners masquerading as a social network notification and placed on third-party resources by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-23' style='color:red'>cybercriminals.Users</span>can also land on phishing pages if the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-24' style='color:red'>computer</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-25' style='color:red'>router</span>was infected with malware that could, for instance, modify or replace the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-26' style='color:red'>'hosts'</span>file, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-27' style='color:red'>spoof</span>the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-28' style='color:red'>DNS</span>or replace the content. This kind of malware is especially dangerous as they redirect users to phishing pages when they follow legitimate links to organizations whose sites are undergoing phishing attacks. </p><p id=p515>This is why users need to pay attention to the availability or non-availability of a secure connection whenever they open a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-29' style='color:red'>webpage.</span>Facebook uses the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-30' style='color:red'>HTTPS</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-31' style='color:red'>protocol</span>to transmit data. The absence of a secure connection even when the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-32' style='color:red'>URL</span>address is correct probably means that you are visiting a fraudulent site. </p><p id=p565>However, the correct URL address and the availability of a secure connection cannot always guarantee that you have not stumbled onto a fraudulent <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-33' style='color:red'>page.</span>If in doubt, check that the certificate belongs to Facebook. Also, always pay attention to any notifications from the security software installed on your computer. </p><p id=p614>Email messages </p><p id=p616>Sending email messages is a popular method for cybercriminals to send links to phishing pages. These messages are often impersonal, i.e. contain no direct addresses to a specific person, and typically imitate a Facebook message notifying that a personal message has arrived, or that the user's friends have registered in this social network. If users click on the link, they land on a phishing site prompting them to enter their credentials. Those credentials are immediately sent to the cybercriminals, and users are redirected to the real Facebook <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-34' style='color:red'>login</span>page. </p><p id=p705>Cybercriminals often resort to intimidation, sending fake messages that threaten to block users' accounts. To avoid that, users are instructed to follow a link provided in the message and enter their login credentials on the webpage. This approach relies on shocking the victim into carelessness. </p><p id=p750>Below is an example of a fake Facebook message notifying a user of recent activities that s/he may have missed. If you position the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-35' style='color:red'>cursor</span>on the link, the popup window shows that it leads to an unknown address which is different from the official Facebook address. Interestingly, the cybercriminals use part of the recipient's email address to address the user. </p><p id=p811>Here is another example of a fake message – this time in Portuguese. The recipient is warned that the account may be blocked soon. To avoid this, the user is advised to follow a link that supposedly leads to Facebook, and enter his/her credentials there. However, placing the cursor over the link shows that it leads to an unrelated site and not to Facebook. </p><p id=p875>Social networks </p><p id=p877>Often phishing messages are sent within the social network from compromised accounts registered by the friends of the potential victim. They typically imitate short personal messages and contain a question like "Is that you in this photo?" and a link to the "photo". When users follow the link provided, they land on a fake Facebook login page that contains the standard message <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-36' style='color:red'>"Log</span>in to continue". If users don't become suspicious and enter their credentials, their data will immediately be dispatched to cybercriminals. </p><p id=p960>All over the globe </p><p id=p964><span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-37' style='color:red'>Facebook's</span>global popularity means cybercriminals create fake web pages in a variety of languages: English, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Turkish, Arabic and others. </p><p id=p987>Several examples of fake Facebook pages are given below. Pay attention to the address bar: cybercriminals often use words resembling "Facebook" in the URL address of the phishing page, trying to disorient inexperienced Internet users. At times, the URL does not have anything in common with the Facebook address even though the page design mimics that of genuine Facebook pages. Also, notice that no secure connection is available at these pages, which is a sure sign that that is a phishing resource. </p><p id=p1069>Examples of phishing sites imitating Facebook login pages </p><p id=p1077>Examples of phishing sites imitating the main Facebook login page, containing a registration form requiring personal data </p><p id=p1094>As can be seen in the examples, the phishing sites are designed to imitate Facebook's login or registration page. The cybercriminals' aim is obviously to collect personal data with which to gain access to accounts for further malicious actions. </p><p id=p1133>Mobile phishing </p><p id=p1135>Smartphone or tablet owners who visit social networks from their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-38' style='color:red'>mobile</span>devices are also in danger of losing their personal data. Cybercriminals create dedicated web pages for mobile browsers that imitate the Facebook app login procedure. </p><p id=p1171>Examples of phishing sites mimicking Facebook for mobile browsers </p><p id=p1180>Some mobile browsers hide the address bar while opening the page, which plays into the cybercriminals' hands. This makes it much more difficult for the user to detect the falsification. </p><p id=p1210>A phishing webpage with a hidden address bar </p><p id=p1218><span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-39' style='color:red'>Malware</span>programs which steal the owner's personal data may also be active on mobile devices. This stolen information can include social network account credentials. As well as general purpose <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-40' style='color:red'>spyware,</span>there are specialized mobile spyware programs specifically targeting social networks. For instance, a mobile <span class='token pointer' id='tok-86-41' style='color:red'>Trojan</span>can spoof the official Facebook application when the user launches it, so a phishing application will open. Also, there is a risk that the user may download a phishing application imitating the official Facebook mobile application.
