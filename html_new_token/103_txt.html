Practicing security in every aspect of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-7' style='color:red'>digital communication</span>ultimately protect you, your website and visitors. </p><p id=p71>This post is the first in a series of personal security guides that can be used to strengthen </p><p id=p92>The First Line of Defense – <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-8' style='color:red'>BrowsersThe</span>web browser is the most common source of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-9' style='color:red'>infection</span>for digital devices and computers. Although <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-10' style='color:red'>malicious email attachments and links</span>still a problem, most viruses, ransomware and unwanted programs spread by visiting hacked or malicious websites. </p><p id=p136>Making sure your browser is properly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-11' style='color:red'>configured</span>and locked down is important.  This will apply regardless of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-12' style='color:red'>operating system</span>you use. </p><p id=p159>1. Choosing a BrowserNot all browsers are created equal. Most browsers offer built-in security options that can greatly improve security, but many browsers are built to satisfy a requirement or collect personal information. </p><p id=p192>For example, Microsoft and Apple needed to create browsers (IE/Edge and Safari) so that users of their devices could access the internet. Nowadays, many people use these browsers only as long as it takes to download to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-13' style='color:red'>or Firefox as</span>alternative. </p><p id=p236>Google Chrome is the most popular browser today. It is great as far as security, but privacy is a different matter. Google tracks your browsing behavior and user data to build your unique marketing profile. This improves Google's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-14' style='color:red'>AdSense network, allowing</span>to target you with ads that you'll more than likely be interested in. </p><p id=p291>I use Mozilla Firefox because they are open source, offer more security extensions, and have fewer privacy issues than other browsers. </p><p id=p312>I have also tried various privacy-and-security-focused browsers based on Chromium in the past.  The problem is that any time there is an update, these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-15' style='color:red'>spinoff browsers</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-16' style='color:red'>take weeks to patch.</span>means your browser has <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-17' style='color:red'>security vulnerabilities</span>you are at the mercy of the developer to release an update. </p><p id=p363>2. Browsing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-18' style='color:red'>Settings</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-19' style='color:red'>PreferencesFor</span>this section, I will be focusing on tweaking the Firefox Preferences panel for added security and privacy, but many of these steps can be replicated in other browsers and the significance of each option is explained. </p><p id=p404>i. UpdatesFirst, go to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-20' style='color:red'>></span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-21' style='color:red'>Firefox</span>Firefox and make sure you see Firefox is up to date so you know you are using the current version. Like with your website, it is important to keep all software updated to ensure you have the </p><p id=p450>If you look under Firefox > Preferences > Advanced > Update you should select the checkbox to Automatically install updates (recommended: improved security) and check the box to keep Search Engines updated as well. </p><p id=p484><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-22' style='color:red'>ii. CertificatesSome</span>websites ask you to identify yourself with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-23' style='color:red'>personal certificate.</span>ensure this information isn't given out automatically, look under Advanced > Certificates and change the setting called When a server requests <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-24' style='color:red'>your personal certificate</span>the  Ask me every time option. </p><p id=p527>In order to ensure that the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-25' style='color:red'>certificates</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-26' style='color:red'>SSL</span>valid on websites that you visit, you should also check the box for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-27' style='color:red'>OCSP</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-28' style='color:red'>Query</span>servers to confirm the current validity of certificates. </p><p id=p560>iii. Data <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-29' style='color:red'>ProtectionStill</span>working within the Advanced Preferences, under Network > Data Choices, I have all boxes unchecked. This ensures that Mozilla doesn't collect any information about my browsing habits. </p><p id=p589>iv. Redirect ProtectionBy default, most redirects will open automatically in a new tab or window. This includes pop-ups and potentially malicious content. Under the General tab of your Firefox preferences, check the option to Warn you when websites try to redirect or reload the page. This ensures that unwanted redirects will not open and execute malicious content unless you click a button and allow the page to load. </p><p id=p656>3. Security Settings and PreferencesUnder the Firefox Preferences > Security, I have the first four boxes selected. These all act as defenses against <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-30' style='color:red'>phishing,</span>drive-by downloads, and unwanted software. </p><p id=p685>Next, click the Exceptions button next to Warn you when sites try to install add-ons and remove all sites you have listed there (including the Mozilla Firefox sites). This way you have to always give permission before any add-ons are used in your browser. </p><p id=p729>Under Logins make sure you have both unchecked and click the Saved Logins button to remove anything you have there. </p><p id=p749>Keeping passwords stored in your browser is NEVER a good idea. Many browsers store them in plain text, allowing malware infections to scrape them and compromise your accounts. Use a password manager instead! I will cover that in my next post about account security. </p><p id=p792>The screenshot below is how I have the Privacy section configured. This includes using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-31' style='color:red'>Tracking</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-32' style='color:red'>Protection,</span>and custom settings for handling browser history. By ensuring that cookies are not accepted and removed when the browser is closed, any active login sessions are removed which helps prevent <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-33' style='color:red'>hijacking.</span></p><p id=p840>Under Content Preferences, I have the box for Block pop-up windows checked and once again, made sure to clear anything listed under the Exceptions button. </p><p id=p864>For Search Preferences, I have removed all search engines and added StartPage as the default and only search engine. Some security-minded people also like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-34' style='color:red'>DuckDuckGo</span>because it also handles user privacy much better than other search engines. </p><p id=p901>In the final set of General Preferences, check the box to Always check if Firefox is your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-35' style='color:red'>default browser</span>and personally I like when Firefox starts I have Show a blank page selected. We have seen cases where website infections that can modify your browser history. This setting ensures that you always open to a fresh set of pages. </p><p id=p960>4. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-36' style='color:red'>Add-Ons and ExtensionsUnder</span>Firefox Tools > <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-37' style='color:red'>Addons</span>> Services, I don't have anything installed. </p><p id=p976>Under Addons > Plugins, I only have the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-38' style='color:red'>Codec</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-39' style='color:red'>Cisco Video</span>but have it set to Never Activate. Many users have Shockwave <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-40' style='color:red'>Flash</span>and other plugins in this section. I recommend removing them or disabling them – especially Flash as it has a history of major security issues.  At the very least you should set them to Ask to Activate so you are notified before activating the plugin. </p><p id=p1044>Recommended ExtensionsHere is the list of add-ons I am currently using for additional security: </p><p id=p1058><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-41' style='color:red'>DisconnectuBlock</span>OriginHTTPS <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-42' style='color:red'>EverywhereNoScriptSelf-Destructing CookiesFollowing,</span>a quick breakdown of what each of them does to help me keep my browsing sessions as secure as possible. </p><p id=p1083>I use Disconnect, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-43' style='color:red'>uBlock Origin,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-44' style='color:red'>NoScript</span>to block ads and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-103-45' style='color:red'>requests from malicious scripts</span>usually I have all JavaScript disabled, but these add-ons help me allow only specific scripts if I need to </p>
