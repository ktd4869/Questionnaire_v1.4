A lot of merchants have adopted or used Bitcoin in one way or another over the last few years. Many <span class='token pointer' id='tok-147-51' style='color:red'>Ecommerce</span>stores have already embraced Bitcoin technology. You can purchase items on websites like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-147-52' style='color:red'>Overstock,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-147-53' style='color:red'>Newegg Tiger Direct,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-147-54' style='color:red'>Expedia</span>with Bitcoin. Now, there are also physical stores that accept it. Here in New York City, there is a wide variety of bars, coffee shops and other independent stores that accept Bitcoin. </p><p id=p713>Perhaps most notably, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-147-55' style='color:red'>Darknet</span>marketplaces like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-147-56' style='color:red'>AlphaBay</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-147-57' style='color:red'>Hansa,</span>along with the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-147-58' style='color:red'>DDoS-for-Hire</span>industry, have adopted BTC as their currency of choice.

One that stands out to me is the fact that criminals cannot steal your payment information from the merchant like they can with credit cards.
