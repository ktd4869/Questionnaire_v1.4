Because <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-6' style='color:red'>functionality</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-7' style='color:red'>settings</span>change with surprising frequency, it's a good idea to assess your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-8' style='color:red'>account preferences</span>But if you are not particularly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-9' style='color:red'>security-savvy,</span>it can be hard to know what specific things to look for. In this guide we'll lay out a few things to consider. </p><p id=p100>"I was surprised how many <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-10' style='color:red'>security-related</span>features were listed in totally different areas. "While the most obvious place to start looking for security-related settings would be security or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-11' style='color:red'>privacy</span>tabs, you shouldn't stop there. In my own searches, I was surprised how many security-related features were listed in totally different areas. When in doubt, click through all the various tabs available in the settings or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-12' style='color:red'>preferences</span>pages for your accounts, to see what is there. Here are a few things to keep an eye out for: </p><p id=p186>Login credentials Different social media sites have a fairly wide variety of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-13' style='color:red'>options</span>available for preserving the security of your login credentials. At this point most social media sites offer some sort of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-14' style='color:red'>two-factor</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-15' style='color:red'>authentication.</span>They may also provide a list of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-16' style='color:red'>devices</span>already logged into your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-17' style='color:red'>account</span>that you can check for suspicious entries, and you can <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-18' style='color:red'>enable</span>notifications for new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-19' style='color:red'>logins.</span>You should also check lists of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-20' style='color:red'>apps</span>approved to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-21' style='color:red'>access</span>your account, and remove those you no longer use. </p><p id=p268>Viewing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-22' style='color:red'>content</span>and postsAnother important item to check is who has <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-23' style='color:red'>permission</span>to view your posts. There are certain aspects of your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-24' style='color:red'>profile</span>that cannot be made <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-25' style='color:red'>private</span>– usually at least whatever is used as your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-26' style='color:red'>avatar</span>or profile picture, and some basic information such as a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-27' style='color:red'>username</span>– so choose these items with this in mind. Most sites will allow you to protect your posts, and some allow you to do so with varying levels of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-28' style='color:red'>granularity.</span>Even if you have set limited audiences for your posts, it's still a good idea to post as if anything you say could be publicly exposed. </p><p id=p373>Contact info and locationSocial media offers people all sorts of different ways to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-29' style='color:red'>contact</span>you. Aside from any direct <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-30' style='color:red'>messaging</span>options, they may require you to input your email or phone numbers, and in some cases even your physical address, and those items may be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-31' style='color:red'>searchable.Even</span>if they do not ask you to type in your address, they may automatically add your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-32' style='color:red'>GPS</span>location unless you <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-33' style='color:red'>disable</span>this functionality. You can usually limit the visibility of your contact methods, or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-34' style='color:red'>restrict</span>who can look you up if they already have access to your name, email address or phone number. </p><p id=p472>Sending <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-35' style='color:red'>messages</span>and commentsSome sites allow you to limit who can message you or who can comment on your posts. You may either be able to do this by selecting or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-36' style='color:red'>blocking</span>groups, or by blocking specific people. </p><p id=p510>Photo and video tagsWhere there are pictures and videos on social sites, you will inevitably find <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-37' style='color:red'>tagging.</span>If you want to have the right to approve whether others can link your profile to photos, you will generally need to enable this <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-38' style='color:red'>option,</span>as it is rarely (if ever) the </p><p id=p561><span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-39' style='color:red'>Tracking</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-40' style='color:red'>adsMost</span>websites – not just social networking sites – use some level of tracking in order to display personalized ads. Some social sites may allow you to adjust how or when you are tracked, or which ads are displayed. </p><p id=p602>Notifications Receiving notifications from social sites can be sort of a mixed bag: they can let you know when something unexpected and unwanted is happening, or they can be a flood of potentially <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-41' style='color:red'>private information</span>through an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-42' style='color:red'>unencrypted</span>channel where they can potentially be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-43' style='color:red'>hijacked</span>for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-44' style='color:red'>nefarious</span>purposes. </p><p id=p651><span class='token pointer' id='tok-90-45' style='color:red'>Curating</span>your list of preferred types and methods of notification you receive can tip the scales in your favor.

By checking your settings with certain categories in mind, you can cut through the confusion and keep your account more secure.
