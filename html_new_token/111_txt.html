However, in this blog I am going to speak to why WAF and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-6' style='color:red'>DDoS filtering</span>a great pair, focusing on the difference between and the benefits of combining the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-7' style='color:red'>firewall</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-8' style='color:red'>web application</span>and DDoS filtering. </p><p id=p75>When discussing DDoS defenses, we must note that there are both on and off-premises filtering solutions. Off-premises approaches are either ISP or cloud-based where the majority of the filtering takes place away from the target's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-9' style='color:red'>network</span>and are generally better at bulk filtering associated with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-10' style='color:red'>volumetric attacks.</span>solutions have an appliance that sits near the targets <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-11' style='color:red'>network's</span>edge, filtering DDoS traffic. These solutions are generally better at filtering <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-12' style='color:red'>encryption,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-13' style='color:red'>protocol,</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-14' style='color:red'>web application-based</span></p><p id=p150>On-premises DDoS protection solutions have come a long way in the past few years. Huge breakthroughs have been made in their ability to support identification and filtering of web application DDoS attacks which attempt to either exploit specific functions/features within a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-15' style='color:red'>web-facing</span>web application in order to render those functions/features inoperable or to research, identify, and exploit a broader set of vulnerabilities with an organization's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-16' style='color:red'>network architecture.</span>former can manifest itself as anything from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-17' style='color:red'>and/or</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-18' style='color:red'>disrupting transactions</span>access to the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-19' style='color:red'>backend databases</span>stopping search functionality, disrupting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-20' style='color:red'>browser</span>access or stopping other services within a web application, such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-21' style='color:red'>email notifications.</span>latter can manifest itself in multiple ways, but is often a two phased attack where the first phase renders an web application dysfunctional and the second phase then exploits another web application and exfiltrates its data. Ultimately, success in mitigating web application DDoS attacks requires correctly segregating and filtering incoming human traffic (real) from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-22' style='color:red'>simulated traffic</span>by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-23' style='color:red'>bots</span>and </p><p id=p316>[You might also like: The Not-So-Odd Couple of DDoS and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-24' style='color:red'>WAF]</span></p><p id=p327>WAF technology works a little differently. While <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-25' style='color:red'>WAFs</span>can analyze <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-26' style='color:red'>HTTP</span>requests, they also protect more of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-27' style='color:red'>application</span>stack. WAFs seek to identify how an application works beyond the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-28' style='color:red'>communications layer.</span>analyze the types of requests and inputs for those request presented to the underlying application to discern how "normal" requests and inputs should be constructed and delivered to the application. The underlying technology can be used for any commercial, off-the-shelf <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-29' style='color:red'>(COTS)</span>or custom applications, but must either learn about or be tuned for the function of each specific application in the environment it protects. Since the WAF looks for attacks leveraged against the underlying application functionality, it can detect not only common attacks such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-30' style='color:red'>SQL</span>injection (SQLi) and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-31' style='color:red'>(XSS</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-32' style='color:red'>cross-site scripting</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-33' style='color:red'>CSS),</span>but can also detect other modified or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-34' style='color:red'>custom constructed queries</span>inputs targeted at an application attempting to trick, defraud, or compromise an application in some way–each of which are outside the purview of a DDoS attack mitigation solution. In addition to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-35' style='color:red'>identifying</span>untrustworthy application interactions, newer WAF technologies can also create user fingerprints by the way users behave in the interactions with the application. Both malicious and nonmalicious application users tend to behave in a consistent manner when using an application so users can be identified by the way they move through the application and what parts they interact with. The way the user interacts with the application is not affected by changing the users' <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-36' style='color:red'>domain</span>affiliation and/or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-37' style='color:red'>IP</span>address and thus does not affect the fingerprint, so the WAF solution can still detect that user as previously being a good or bad client. </p><p id=p599>Both WAF and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-38' style='color:red'>on-premises</span>DDoS mitigation solutions may use device fingerprinting to identify both "good" and "bad" users. Good users are identified by consistent behaviors that are interacting with the application within normal parameters while bad users would be the opposite. To create the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-39' style='color:red'>device fingerprint,</span>WAF or DDoS solution interrogates the client gathering many different information points about the device in order to uniquely identify that device. New devices are monitored while interacting with the application, then classified as good or bad and added to a database for future reference should they attempt to communicate again in the future. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-40' style='color:red'>Device fingerprinting</span>also domain and IP independent so users can be identified no matter where they come from. </p><p id=p719>While both technologies work using variations of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-111-41' style='color:red'>pattern matching (signatures)</span>capture simple attacks, the solutions that apply behavioral analysis to filter out the more sophisticated attacks are able to capture more advanced client and application interactions and thus provide a highly complementary and more effective solution set. Each can operate within its own domain without the other, but companies using either solution alone are more likely to experience successful attacks leading to service degradation and outages.  Combining the two technologies creates a situation where the sum of the parts is greater than each individually thus making the investment in both technologies.
