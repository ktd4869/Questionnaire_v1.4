Within the secure network, an IDS/IDPS discovers suspicious activities to/from hosts and within the traffic itself and can take proactive measures to log and block attacks. </p><p id=p132>In intrusion detection system we have two common types of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-14' style='color:red'>IDS,</span>Network Based <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-15' style='color:red'>Intrusion</span>Detection System <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-16' style='color:red'>(NIDS)</span>and Host Based Intrusion Detection System <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-17' style='color:red'>(HIDS)</span>that are widely used. </p><p id=p160>NIDS: Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) attempts to identify unauthorized, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-18' style='color:red'>illicit,</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-19' style='color:red'>anomalous</span>behavior based solely on network traffic. The role of a network IDS is passive, only gathering, identifying, logging and alerting. It <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-20' style='color:red'>monitors</span>traffic on a network looking for suspicious activity, which could be an attack or unauthorized activity. </p><p id=p211>HIDS: A <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-21' style='color:red'>host-based</span>intrusion detection system (HIDS) examines all or parts of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-22' style='color:red'>dynamic</span>behavior and the state of a computer system. It monitors and analyzes the internals of a computing system as well as (in some cases) the network packets on its network interfaces. An HIDS gives you deep visibility of what's happening on your critical systems. </p><p id=p269>Both types of Intrusion Detection System involve the gathering and analysis of information from a variety of areas contained in a computer or network to identify possible threats posed by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-23' style='color:red'>hackers</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-24' style='color:red'>crackers</span>inside or outside the organization. However, the most effective <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-25' style='color:red'>fortification</span>for a corporate network is provided by a combination of both technologies. </p><p id=p324>IDS is It's simply a security <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-26' style='color:red'>software</span>which is termed to help user or system administrator by automatically alerting or notifying when a user attempts to compromise information system through any <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-27' style='color:red'>malicious</span>activities or at the point where a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-28' style='color:red'>violation</span>of security policies is taken. These detections are operated by inspecting traffic that occurs between hosts. These mechanisms are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-29' style='color:red'>prorated</span>into two major forms. </p><p id=p388><span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-30' style='color:red'>Signature</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-31' style='color:red'>detectionAnomaly</span>detectionSignature Detection:This type of detection works well with the threads that are already determined or known. It implicates searching a series of bytes or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-32' style='color:red'>sequence</span>that are termed to be malicious. One of the most profitable points is that signatures are easy to apply and develop once you figure out the sort of network behavior to be found out. </p><p id=p449>The main drawback to signature based IDS is that it's easy to fool signature-based solutions by changing the ways in which an attack is made and the more advanced the IDS Signature database, the higher the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-33' style='color:red'>CPU</span>load for the system charged with analyzing each signature. </p><p id=p495><span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-34' style='color:red'>Anomaly</span>Detection: The anomaly detection technique is a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-35' style='color:red'>centralized</span>process that works on the concept of a baseline for network behavior. This baseline is a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-36' style='color:red'>depiction</span>of accepted network behavior, which is learned or specified by the network administrators, or both. It's like a guard personally interviewing everyone at the gate before they are let down the drive. </p><p id=p553>One of the major drawbacks of anomaly detection <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-37' style='color:red'>engines</span>is the difficulty of defining rules. Each protocol being analyzed must be defined, implemented and tested for accuracy which is not always an easy task. </p><p id=p587>Whether you need to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-38' style='color:red'>monitor</span>your own network or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-39' style='color:red'>Host</span>by connecting them to identify any latest threats, there are various free Intrusion Detection Systems that offer outstanding functionalities and can be used at the enterprise level. Many, if not most, of these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-40' style='color:red'>intrusion-detection</span>systems (IDS), uses a combination of engines, to create solid, free intrusion-detection services. </p><p id=p644>Ethical Hacking Training – Resources (InfoSec) </p><p id=p650>  </p><p id=p651>Security <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-41' style='color:red'>Onion: </span></p><p id=p653>Security Onion is an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-42' style='color:red'>Ubuntu-based</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-43' style='color:red'>Linux</span>distribution used for network monitoring and intrusion detection. It can monitor multiple <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-44' style='color:red'>VLANs</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-45' style='color:red'>subnets</span>and works fine in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-46' style='color:red'>VMware</span>and other virtual environments. This configuration can be used as IDS only. At present, it isn't supported to be run as an IPS. However, there is the option to run as a network and host intrusion detection deployment that contains tools and services such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-47' style='color:red'>Squil,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-48' style='color:red'>Bro</span>IDS, and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-49' style='color:red'>OSSEC</span>to perform the IDS functionality. However, Security Onion needs more assistance with development, which will most likely happen in time. The easy-to-use Setup <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-50' style='color:red'>wizard</span>allows building a group of numerous distributed sensors for enterprise in minutes. </p><p id=p765>  </p><p id=p766>OSSEC:  </p><p id=p767>OSSEC is an open source host intrusion detection system (HIDS) which offers multiple additional <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-51' style='color:red'>modules</span>that can be used with the core functionality of IDS. In addition to intrusion detection, the OSSEC can perform file <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-52' style='color:red'>integrity</span>monitoring and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-53' style='color:red'>rootkit</span>detection with real-time alerts, all of which are centrally managed with the ability to create different policies, depending on a company's needs. The OSSEC can locally run on most operating systems, including Linux versions, Mac OSX and Windows. </p><p id=p844>  </p><p id=p845><span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-54' style='color:red'>OpenWIPS-NG: </span></p><p id=p846>OpenWIPS-NG is a wireless <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-55' style='color:red'>IDS/IPS</span>that relies on a server, sensors, and interfaces and available freely.

Bro IDS uses a combination of tools. Bro is considered a specification-based network IDS. It uses a wide range of protocol analysis modules to inspect traffic and make decisions regarding its <span class='token pointer' id='tok-105-61' style='color:red'>conformance</span>to various norms. It is a very powerful complement to Snort. </p><p id=p1045>However, the list free IDS is not limited to the IDS mentioned above only; there are many Intrusion Detection Systems as well. The power of IDS is that it demonstrates a positive degree of readiness, which may be critical for long-term success. If your business relies on networking, then implementing IDS is essential to prevent intruders from harming your business.
