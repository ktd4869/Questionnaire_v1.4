<p id=p0>New Intelligence Academy Aims to Help Organizations Reduce <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-0' style='color:red'>Risk</span>by Better Understanding Threats and Prioritizing Response </p><p id=p14><span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-1' style='color:red'>Business Risk Intelligence (BRI)</span>a term that is easy to understand in concept, but difficult to action in practice. The problem is that business structures are all too <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-2' style='color:red'>silos</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-3' style='color:red'>often</span>individual responsibilities. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-4' style='color:red'>Cyber security</span>is a good example. Different <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-5' style='color:red'>control functions</span>often silos with little inter-control functionality. But cyber security itself is also a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-6' style='color:red'>siloed</span>department within the business -- again with little inter-departmental functionality. </p><p id=p85>Risk, however, is not siloed <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-7' style='color:red'>-- risk affects the whole</span>and honors no siloed structure. Risk management needs to be treated <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-8' style='color:red'>holistically,</span>analyzing business risk rather than just <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-9' style='color:red'>cyber</span>risk -- because, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-10' style='color:red'>says Flashpoint's</span>BRI principal advisor, Brian <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-11' style='color:red'>Mohr,</span>in blog <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-12' style='color:red'>post,</span>BRI includes not just cyber and insider risk, but also "global risk, fraud, anti-money laundering, executive protection, and physical security, to name a few." These risks are inter-related; and business needs to adopt an integrated approach to BRI. </p><p id=p163>The solution to risk is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-13' style='color:red'>threat intelligence</span>but <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-14' style='color:red'>most cyber threat intelligence sources</span>disjointed. For example, in a 2016 analysis of 88 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-15' style='color:red'>IP-based</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-16' style='color:red'>blacklists</span>and 35 domain name blacklists, Carnegie Mellon found that the majority of threat-indicated sources appeared on only one of the lists. For maximum threat intelligence, risk managers would need to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-17' style='color:red'>subscribe</span>to all the lists -- and risk being overwhelmed by noise within the intelligence. And they would still be limiting their intelligence to the cyber realm alone. </p><p id=p247>But for true business <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-18' style='color:red'>risk intelligence,</span>more factors need to be included -- such as geopolitical flashpoints, potential exchange rate fluctuations, staff travel arrangements and more. For example, "Few threats expose the true <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-19' style='color:red'>interdependency</span>of cyber and physical security more than those targeting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-20' style='color:red'>the oil and natural gas</span>sector," wrote <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-21' style='color:red'>Flashpoint</span>CEO Josh <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-22' style='color:red'>Lefkowitz</span>in a blog earlier this month. "After all, oil and natural gas together account for 53 percent of the world's energy consumption and remain integral determinants of both global trade and the economy." </p><p id=p336>In its January 2017 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-23' style='color:red'>Business Risk Intelligence</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-24' style='color:red'>Report, Flashpoint</span>on this principle. "Traditional cyber threat intelligence, which has been largely focused on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-25' style='color:red'>indicators of compromise,</span>insufficient in supporting the risk decision-making process, as it too often limits its focus on events in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-26' style='color:red'>cyberspace,"</span>it warned. "Not all actors constrain their operations solely to the cyber realm; top tier nation-states like the U.S. and Russia use the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-27' style='color:red'>full-spectrum of their capabilities</span>achieve their objectives. A threat assessment of Chinese or Russian cyber operations without the context of the national objectives they are supporting fails to provide risk decision-makers with an accurate portrayal of the threat landscape upon which to make business decisions." </p><p id=p451>To aid corporations take the required <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-28' style='color:red'>holistic</span>view of business risk, Flashpoint offers its own BRI service. It gathers the intelligence and performs the analysis of that intelligence for its customers. It combines the different threat indicators into an holistic risk analysis, delivering integrated business risk intelligence. </p><p id=p498>But one basic problem remains -- not all companies know how to use the intelligence they receive. "Having spent my career in the government and the intelligence community, as well as at a Fortune 10 company," writes Mohr, "I understand without hesitation that the fundamental purpose of intelligence is to support decision-making. However, I also understand the struggles of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-29' style='color:red'>implementing</span>the intelligence lifecycle into practical business use." </p><p id=p565>Lefkowitz and his team at the New York, NY-based threat intelligence and research company have many years' experience of working both within national intelligence agencies and major international corporations. For example, Mohr spent 15 years as a Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence Specialist for the U.S. Marine Corps, conducting both <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-30' style='color:red'>human intelligence activities</span>support of U.S. combat units in the Middle East, as well as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-31' style='color:red'>technical counterintelligence investigations</span>the Asia-Pacific theater. He then spent two years with the cyber threat intelligence team at American Express. </p><p id=p649>It is this combination of pure <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-32' style='color:red'>intelligence analysis</span>business understanding that Flashpoint now wishes to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-33' style='color:red'>disseminate.</span>It has today <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-34' style='color:red'>launched</span>the Flashpoint Intelligence Academy (FIA). Its purpose is to help organizations understand how to structure an action program that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-35' style='color:red'>embraces</span>the full combined intelligence of BRI. </p><p id=p696>"We created FIA as a means to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-36' style='color:red'>transfer</span>what we've learned from our own experiences in building intelligence programs to our customers in a meaningful way," explains Mohr. "I came to Flashpoint because I realized that the company was helping its customers, not from the standpoint of just <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-37' style='color:red'>blocking</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-38' style='color:red'>IOCs,</span>but actually supporting customers to reduce their overall risk. And I know FIA is the program to continue to support that goal." </p><p id=p768>The FIA offers foundational (one-day sessions); intermediate (two or three-day sessions); and advanced <span class='token pointer' id='tok-168-39' style='color:red'>workshops.</span>These workshops are available to any organization involved in actioning BRI, and not just Flashpoint customers. "Using the BRI principles taught in these workshops," says the on-site blurb, "organizations can better understand the threats they may face, prioritize their responses, make more informed decisions, and become a source for developing and driving risk intelligence application across the business." </p><p id=p840>Flashpoint raised $28 million in Series C funding in July 2017, after raising $10 million in July 2016.  </p><p id=p858>TweetKevin Townsend is a Senior Contributor at SecurityWeek.
