<p id=p0><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-0' style='color:red'>Breaches</span>involving major players in the hospitality industry continue to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-1' style='color:red'>pile</span>up. Today, travel industry giant <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-2' style='color:red'>Sabre</span>Corp. disclosed what could be a significant <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-3' style='color:red'>breach</span>of payment and customer <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-4' style='color:red'>data</span>tied to bookings processed through a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-5' style='color:red'>system</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-6' style='color:red'>reservations</span>serves more than 32,000 hotels and other lodging establishments. </p><p id=p47>In a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, Southlake, Texas-based Sabre said it was "investigating an incident of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-7' style='color:red'>unauthorized</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-8' style='color:red'>access</span>to payment <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-9' style='color:red'>information</span>contained in a subset of hotel reservations processed through our Hospitality Solutions <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-10' style='color:red'>SynXis</span>Central Reservations system." </p><p id=p91>According to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-11' style='color:red'>Sabre's</span>marketing literature, more than 32,000 properties use Sabre's SynXis reservations system, described as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-12' style='color:red'>management</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-13' style='color:red'>Software-as-a-Service</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-14' style='color:red'>an inventory</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-15' style='color:red'>application</span>that "enables hoteliers to support a multitude of rate, inventory and distribution strategies to achieve their business goals." </p><p id=p130>Sabre said it has engaged <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-16' style='color:red'>forensics</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-17' style='color:red'>security</span>Mandiant to support its investigation, and that it has notified law enforcement. </p><p id=p150>"The unauthorized access has been shut off and there is no evidence of continued unauthorized activity," reads a brief statement that Sabre sent to affected properties today. "There is no reason to believe that any other Sabre <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-18' style='color:red'>systems</span>beyond SynXis Central Reservations have been affected." </p><p id=p195>Sabre's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-19' style='color:red'>software,</span>data, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-20' style='color:red'>mobile</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-21' style='color:red'>solutions</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-22' style='color:red'>distribution</span>used by hundreds of airlines and thousands of hotel properties to manage critical operations, including passenger and guest reservations, revenue management, flight, network and crew management. Sabre also operates a leading global travel marketplace, which processes more than $110 billion of estimated travel spend annually by connecting travel buyers and suppliers. </p><p id=p254>Sabre told customers that it didn't have any additional details about the breach to share at this time, so it remains unclear what the exact cause of the breach may be or for how long it may have persisted. </p><p id=p293>A <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-23' style='color:red'>card</span>involving traveler transactions for even a small percentage of the 32,000 properties that are using Sabre's impacted <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-24' style='color:red'>technology</span>could jeopardize a significant number of customer credit cards in a short amount of time. </p><p id=p328>The news comes amid revelations about a blossoming breach at Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG), the parent company that manages some 5,000 hotels worldwide, including Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express. </p><p id=p358>KrebsOnSecurity first reported in December 2016 that cards used at IHG properties were being sold to fraudsters, but it took until February 2017 for IHG to announce it had found <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-25' style='color:red'>malicious</span>software installed at front-desk systems at just a dozen of its properties. On April 18, IHG disclosed in an update on the investigation that more than 1,200 properties were affected, and that there could well be more added in the coming days. </p><p id=p431>According to Verizon's latest annual <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-26' style='color:red'>Data Breach Investigations Report</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-27' style='color:red'>malware</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-28' style='color:red'>attacks</span>on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-29' style='color:red'>point-of-sale</span>systems used at front desk and hotel restaurant systems "are absolutely rampant" in the hospitality sector. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-30' style='color:red'>Accommodation</span>was the top industry for point-of-sale intrusions in this year's data, with 87% of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-31' style='color:red'>breaches</span>within that pattern. </p><p id=p480>"Apparently, it is not only The Eagles that are destined for a long stay at the hotel," Verizon mused in its report. "The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-32' style='color:red'>hackers</span>continue to be checked in indefinitely as well. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-33' style='color:red'>Breach</span>timelines continue to paint a rather dismal picture—with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-34' style='color:red'>time-to-compromise</span>being only seconds, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-35' style='color:red'>time-to-exfiltration</span>taking days, and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-36' style='color:red'>containment</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-37' style='color:red'>times to discovery and</span>firmly in the months camp." </p><p id=p540>Card-stealing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-38' style='color:red'>cyber thieves</span>broken into some of the largest hotel chains over the past few years. Hotel brands that have acknowledged card breaches over the last year after prompting by KrebsOnSecurity include Kimpton Hotels, Trump Hotels (twice), Hilton, Mandarin Oriental, and White Lodging (twice). Card breaches also have hit hospitality chains Starwood Hotels and Hyatt.  </p><p id=p593>In many of those incidents, thieves planted <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-39' style='color:red'>malicious software</span>the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-40' style='color:red'>point-of-sale devices</span>restaurants and bars inside of the hotel <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-41' style='color:red'>chains. Point-of-sale</span>based malware has driven most of the credit card breaches over the past two years, including intrusions at Target and Home Depot, as well as breaches at a slew of point-of-sale vendors. The malicious <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-42' style='color:red'>code usually</span>is installed via <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-43' style='color:red'>remote administration tools.</span>the attackers have their malware loaded onto the point-of-sale devices, they can <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-44' style='color:red'>remotely capture</span>from each card swiped at that cash register. </p><p id=p681>Thieves can then sell that data to crooks who specialize in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-45' style='color:red'>encoding</span>the stolen data onto any card with a magnetic stripe, and using the cards to purchase high-priced <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-46' style='color:red'>electronics</span>and gift cards from big-box stores like Target and Best Buy. </p><p id=p722>Readers should remember that they're not liable for fraudulent charges on their credit or debit cards, but they still have to report the unauthorized transactions. There is no substitute for keeping a close eye on your card statements. Also, consider using credit cards instead of debit cards; having your checking <span class='token pointer' id='tok-139-47' style='color:red'>account</span>emptied of cash while your bank sorts out the situation can be a hassle and lead to secondary problems (bounced checks, for instance).
