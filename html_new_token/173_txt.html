<p id=p0>While attending the 2015 RSA Conference last week, I committed myself to simply being an active onlooker and listener.  </p><p id=p20> Specifically, I spent the week loitering around the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-0' style='color:red'>various</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-1' style='color:red'>surfing"</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-2' style='color:red'>"shoulder</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-3' style='color:red'>eavesdropping</span>on who's saying what to whom and how each side - the solution seeker and the solution provider - perceive one another as it pertains to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-4' style='color:red'>cybersecurity's</span>current up-and-coming rising star, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-5' style='color:red'>Threat Intelligence.</span></p><p id=p71> It's that damn Threat Intelligence. So much disruptive promise (way more in my opinion than persisting with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-6' style='color:red'>updates</span>to sacrosanct and rusting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-7' style='color:red'>solutions),</span>yet so much confusion and noise.  </p><p id=p102> My info-gathering tour at RSA was enlightening, but when I combined it with what I heard from Forrester's Rick Holland this week in his brief "Threat Intelligence is Like Three Day Potty Training," a couple big insights emerged from the intersection of my <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-8' style='color:red'>data</span>and Rick's very thoughtful observations:  </p><p id=p153>Many businesses right now <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-9' style='color:red'>Open Source</span>(OSINT) is the totality of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-10' style='color:red'>threat</span>intelligence and many are willing to pay handsomely for this latest fashion trend without any real notion of how or why to put it to work.  </p><p id=p194>In other words, as I listened to one after another vendor and solution seeker alike, each seemed to convey that gaining usable intelligence on potential <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-11' style='color:red'>cyber</span>threats facing businesses was best <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-12' style='color:red'>accomplished</span>by focusing on data that's freely available on the uppermost parts of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-13' style='color:red'>internet</span>each and every day. And they seemed very willing to pay for tools to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-14' style='color:red'>exploit</span>it in spades based almost solely on the shiny labels.  </p><p id=p266> As Rick points out, and as I observed first hand on the floor, many companies get stuck in the immature, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-15' style='color:red'>"low-hanging-fruit-grab"</span>period of their threat intelligence development. The attractive, available lure of OSINT is all too gratifying to pass up.  </p><p id=p308> But more disturbing for me, from the exchanges I witnessed (and a bit of a twist on what Rick presented), many companies seemed as if they'd be just fine to stick with OSINT-only approaches for what sounded like much longer than an initial period of time.  </p><p id=p356> In fact, as I heard one after another describe how they handled threat intelligence activities day-to-day, far too many described a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-16' style='color:red'>process</span>for daily tasking, triage and justification based solely on a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-17' style='color:red'>web</span>article or a post.  </p><p id=p395>In one case, I even encountered a major <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-18' style='color:red'>infrastructure</span>firm who told me if it couldn't be found on the web, it didn't exist for them as a threat worthy of investigation or as justification for any specific <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-19' style='color:red'>cyberdefense</span>investment! </p><p id=p435> As such, many were on the hunt for ways to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-20' style='color:red'>"up the ante"</span>this process and splurge on a "real live" OSINT-only solution to get even better at the process. And they seemed more than happy to blow the majority of their shiny new threat intelligence budgets on it, leaving room for little else.  </p><p id=p492> In reality, the beauty of threat intelligence is much more than skin deep. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-21' style='color:red'>Open source</span>is just a small part of the threat intelligence picture.  </p><p id=p520> In particular, making use of threat intelligence in your cyber defenses to...  </p><p id=p534><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-22' style='color:red'>•	Raise cross-organizational situational</span> </p><p id=p539>•	Manage risks across your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-23' style='color:red'>internal</span>org and supply chain  </p><p id=p549>•	Speed response (and pre-response) to incidents  </p><p id=p556>•	Prioritize effective use of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-24' style='color:red'>tactical cyber solutions</span></p><p id=p564>•	Collaborate, budget and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-25' style='color:red'>strategize</span>around cyber defense  </p><p id=p572>•	Educate and inform your workforce  </p><p id=p578> ...involves a whole lot more than just OSINT.  </p><p id=p588> The web and all its <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-26' style='color:red'>blogs,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-27' style='color:red'>sites,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-28' style='color:red'>social media posts,</span>and cat videos is a treasure trove of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-29' style='color:red'>information.</span>Well, sometimes. Even so, the internet itself is arguably the single greatest human achievement in our history on this blue-green marble, but it isn't actually reality.  </p><p id=p636> In fact, it isn't even really a shadow of reality. It's more like many groups of collections of individual <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-30' style='color:red'>pixels</span>in several disjointed areas of one much bigger, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-31' style='color:red'>3D</span>image. Sure, one spot may be dark blue, but without information to fill in the white spaces, it's a guessing game as to whether the big picture is indeed a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-32' style='color:red'>fat, funky blue whale</span>something else.  </p><p id=p704>Effective threat intelligence involves comprehensive, continuous collection and analysis of the right data <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-33' style='color:red'>sources,</span>from both inside your organization and out, and combining that with a high degree of relevancy to your specific business profile and characteristics. It's an approach from many levels and angles. It's the cliched 360 degrees and three dimensions.  </p><p id=p758>OSINT tools and sources alone only give you a limited view into what you need to know to accomplish a proactive, effective <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-34' style='color:red'>cyber risk management function</span>helps better protect your business, its financial interests, brand and reputation, partners and customers and information technology baselines.  </p><p id=p804> Effective threat intelligence requires a data collection and analysis approach across all the below...just for starters:  </p><p id=p822>•	OSINT - <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-35' style='color:red'>Websites,</span>blogs, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-36' style='color:red'>forums,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-37' style='color:red'>breach</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-38' style='color:red'>databases,</span>exploit databases, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-39' style='color:red'>malware,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-40' style='color:red'>vulnerability,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-41' style='color:red'>Dark Web sources</span>myriad others  </p><p id=p840>•	Your Own <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-42' style='color:red'>Evaluated</span>Threat <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-43' style='color:red'>Data</span>- Your own team's low-level data that's confirmed as "real" or relevant and diligently recorded, analyzed (e.g. found <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-44' style='color:red'>Trojans</span>or confirmed <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-45' style='color:red'>SNORT hits)</span></p><p id=p869>•	Highly-Focused, Highly-Relevant Data <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-46' style='color:red'>Feeds</span>- Commercial phishing feeds, patch management updates, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-47' style='color:red'>Spam</span>analytics, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-48' style='color:red'>AV/AM,</span>Government alerts and indicators  </p><p id=p888>•	Partner and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-49' style='color:red'>Supply Chain Data</span>Extending reporting, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-50' style='color:red'>sharing</span>and data collection from your own "Private <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-51' style='color:red'>ISAC"</span> </p><p id=p906>•	SIEM Information - Evaluated events from SIEM analysis and exploration  </p><p id=p917>•	TIP Data - HUMINT analysis and other alerts, low-level data from "traditional" Threat Intelligence Platforms that can be confirmed as relevant threat events  </p><p id=p941>What's even more important, specific data about your own business, its products, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-52' style='color:red'>technologies,</span>employees, partners, customers, locations, third-party support providers, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-53' style='color:red'>equipment,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-54' style='color:red'>devices</span>and more is a key ingredient needed to provide real data relevance you can act on.

If it isn't comprehensive, perspicacious and relevant, it's mostly useless.  </p><p id=p1032>As well, more than just data of any specific flavors, effective threat intelligence hinges on the ability to free data from security operations activities and communicate it, share it effectively, integrate it with other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-57' style='color:red'>non-cyber</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-58' style='color:red'>systems</span>and use it to inform <span class='token pointer' id='tok-173-59' style='color:red'>non-technical</span>business strategists, analysts, managers and leaders who steer the larger business.
