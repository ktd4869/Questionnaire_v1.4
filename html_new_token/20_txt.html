To reflect this expansion in content, the name has changed from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-9' style='color:red'>'applicable</span>to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-10' style='color:red'>cyber warfare'</span>'applicable to </p><p id=p106>The Tallinn Manual takes no <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-11' style='color:red'>moral standpoint.</span>starts from the observation that cyber operations are subject to existing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-12' style='color:red'>pre-cyber</span>international law, and then defines how that law should be applied to different cyber operations. This forces it to confront many of the apparent difficulties in international <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-13' style='color:red'>cyber behavior</span>on -- such as the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-14' style='color:red'>applicability</span>of self-defense and the right to strike back, and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-15' style='color:red'>attribution.</span></p><p id=p172>The Tallinn Manual process is led by Michael Schmitt, an expert in the law of armed conflict, Professor of Public International Law at Exeter Law School, and a Senior Fellow at the United States Naval War College. It is authored by nineteen <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-16' style='color:red'>international law</span>Although it has no <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-17' style='color:red'>legal</span>standing and does not represent the views of NATO per se, it has become an influential resource for legal advisers dealing with </p><p id=p246>Schmitt told <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-18' style='color:red'>SecurityWeek</span>that the Manual 1.0 publication became far more popular than was expected. He thought one reason was that it provided a legal position that didn't force governments to declare their own preference. "Governments," he suggested, "want to set legal bars high for potential <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-19' style='color:red'>aggressors</span>while setting them as low as possible for themselves." The Manual takes away that dilemma be presenting the existing legal position under international law. </p><p id=p317>Tallinn 2.0 expands this legal exploration beyond cyber warfare into civilian situations. This makes it more complex because it includes the multitude of cyber intrusions faced by commercial organizations every day. But it is international law rather than any national law that is explored. </p><p id=p361>For example, there is growing enthusiasm for the right for private industry to strike back at aggressors, almost as an extension of self-defense. The law, however, is relatively simple -- they <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-20' style='color:red'>cannot.</span>Schmitt gave an example. "If a foreign nation launched an attack against Exeter University, there would be a right for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-21' style='color:red'>retaliatory</span>action; but not by Exeter University. The attack could be considered as an attack against the UK; but only the UK government could respond." </p><p id=p438><span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-22' style='color:red'>Attribution</span>is another difficult area. The law cannot be applied against a transgressor if the transgressor is not definitively known. There have been attempts to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-23' style='color:red'>develop</span>acceptable methods of attribution; most notably perhaps by Microsoft. Microsoft's proposal would be for an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-24' style='color:red'>international committee</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-25' style='color:red'>independent experts</span>would decide on and name <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-26' style='color:red'>transgressors.</span></p><p id=p491>Schmitt is not a great supporter of this approach; not because it is bad, but because it ultimately depends on recommendations. The law is not about recommendations, but about clear mandates. "I don't know about <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-27' style='color:red'>technical</span>attribution," he told SecurityWeek. "I've heard arguments that it is and it is not possible. But whenever I talk to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-28' style='color:red'>intelligence agencies,</span>all say attribution is not based on simple <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-29' style='color:red'>technology,</span>but on the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-30' style='color:red'>summation</span>of intelligence information -- signals intelligence, field agents, geopolitics and so on." </p><p id=p575>Once a government is confident in its attribution -- and particularly if other governments agree with that attribution -- then the Tallinn Manual can explain the legally permissible response.  </p><p id=p604>Tallinn 2, explains the associated CCDCOE announcement, "covers a full spectrum of international law applicable to cyber operations ranging from peacetime legal regimes to the law of armed conflict, covering a wide array of international law principles and regimes that regulate events in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-31' style='color:red'>cyberspace.</span>Some pertain to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-32' style='color:red'>general international</span>such as the principle of sovereignty and the various bases for the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-20-33' style='color:red'>exercise of jurisdiction.</span>law of state responsibility, which includes the legal standards for attribution, is examined at length. Additionally, numerous specialised regimes of international law, including human rights law, air and space law, the law of the sea, and diplomatic and consular law, are examined in the context of cyber operations." </p><p id=p718>Tallinn Manual 2.0 is available from Cambridge University Press. </p><p id=p727>TweetKevin Townsend is a Senior Contributor at SecurityWeek.
