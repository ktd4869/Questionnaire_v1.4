<p id=p0>A question that I've encountered many times in the field of late is what are the impacts of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-0' style='color:red'>DDoS</span>attacks on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-1' style='color:red'>cloud</span>compute <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-2' style='color:red'>environments? The</span>primary benefit of cloud is that it elastically scales to meet variable demand, scale up instantly, scale down when demand subsides – in seconds…  So layman's logic might say that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-3' style='color:red'>cloud-based</span>services are immune <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-4' style='color:red'>from</span>the downtime effects of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-5' style='color:red'>DDoS attackers,</span>the possibility of gigantic unexpected bills is a given? </p><p id=p75>After exploring the topic with a number of eminent cloud architects and representatives of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-6' style='color:red'>online organizations,</span>experience running primary service on cloud platforms such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-7' style='color:red'>AWS</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-8' style='color:red'>Amazon</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-9' style='color:red'>Azure,</span>here are the seven interlinked complexities that they choose to reflect on: </p><p id=p117> Customer experience is key – The simple fact is that the majority of DDoS attacks have limited ambition of killing a service entirely but rather significantly impair customer experience. So without <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-10' style='color:red'>DDoS protection</span>can distinguish legitimate <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-11' style='color:red'>traffic</span>from bad, it is not uncommon for DDoS attacks to go unnoticed and instead blight customer experience in cloud <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-12' style='color:red'>environments</span>just as they do in traditional physical <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-13' style='color:red'>data centres.</span>number of the below points expand on the where's and how's of this key consideration. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-14' style='color:red'>DDoS infrastructure</span>are different between traditional data centres and cloud – In traditional physical <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-15' style='color:red'>data centre</span>all <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-16' style='color:red'>DDoS payload targeting</span>infrastructure becomes a potential customer experience and economic hit against capacity assumptions. Into cloud environments this pattern changes. For starters, attacks against the underlying infrastructure before the customer's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-17' style='color:red'>front-end apps are</span>dealt with by the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-18' style='color:red'>cloud service provider.</span>are recorded outages where <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-19' style='color:red'>cloud service providers</span>not got things entirely right of course, such as the 2016 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-20' style='color:red'>Dyn</span>attack, but such incidents remain exceptions to the rule for now.  The upshot of in-built protection is that customers do not normally feel the burn of poor user experience or the bill of DDoS attacks hitting shared <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-21' style='color:red'>internet connectivity or APIs.</span>when the attack gets into the customer's personal <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-22' style='color:red'>compute domain,</span>pain occurs.  The user experience degradation is discussed below, focusing now on economic impacts that can vary both within a service and between the different providers.  For example, AWS does not bill you for ingress traffic into an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-23' style='color:red'>Elastic Load Balancer,</span>just pay for the egress traffic, however if the DDoS traffic is getting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-24' style='color:red'>NATed</span>then you would be paying $0.050 per <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-25' style='color:red'>GB processed</span>the inbound traffic.  Obviously when a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-26' style='color:red'>front-end web application</span>to take a hit, then it is only the severity of cost that is variable.

Into an attack the customer would be almost assured of hitting a limitation in licensing, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-27' style='color:red'>O/S</span>threshold, messaging queue or some other interlink between <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-28' style='color:red'>front-end and back-end applications that</span>cause an outage or major service degradation that no end of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-29' style='color:red'>horizontal</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-30' style='color:red'>auto-scaling</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-31' style='color:red'>RAM</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-32' style='color:red'>virtual</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-33' style='color:red'>CPU</span>resources could mitigate. In one sense this scaling failure might protect them from the worst of a so-called <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-34' style='color:red'>EDoS,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-35' style='color:red'>Economic Denial-of-Service attack,</span>a huge bill. Not something to applaud of course. Excess billing prevention is on you – The major cloud providers simply do not provide utilisation caps. It is not that doing so is contra revenue interests (which it is of course), but as much they don't want to be the party that brings their customer's house down due to their involvement in the automatic shutdown of service. For this reason it is down to the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-36' style='color:red'>end users to</span>the thresholds for dollar spend alerts to somehow then run countermeasures to limit the economic blast radius of an EDoS attack. For instance, since 2012 Amazon has had functionality which allows customers to get an aggregate view on their billing across services <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-37' style='color:red'>(S3,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-38' style='color:red'>EC2,</span>etc.) and set alert thresholds around these. Obviously it is on you to determine exactly what you do with the alerts. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-39' style='color:red'>Cloud-architected applications</span>the road to infinite billing – Customers that have gone through the cloud transformation playbook face the nemesis of infinite cloud scale: infinite cloud billing. Stripping back an environment from the traditional limits of scalability in favor of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-40' style='color:red'>cloud-built</span>apps quite simply takes the gloves off a DDoS attack to economically hurt. For this reason such organizations embarking on this transformative cloud journey would have received the very sound advice of cloud migration experts and a multitude of best practice whitepapers to purchase effective <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-41' style='color:red'>DDoS protection. If</span>had not taken heed then the clock is ticking to face down the bill caused by the insatiable demand of an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-42' style='color:red'>IoT</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-43' style='color:red'>botnet!</span>[You might also like: Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?] </p><p id=p831> Knowledge is power, metrics matter – Organizations that take their cloud play highly seriously are some of the most probable organizations to be leveraging an understanding of utilisation to drive a better understanding of customer experience and predicting forward demand for their products. A so-called Data Driven Company. In stark example, a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-44' style='color:red'>streaming</span>service like Netflix would be measuring the volume of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-45' style='color:red'>video commencements,</span>logic being that a higher than normal ratio of commences could indicate a service issue with frustrated users attempting to recommence content on initial failure. It is not difficult to understand that a DDoS attack into the service left unmitigated could completely throw off such metrics and the value they have towards the company bottom line. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-46' style='color:red'>Auto-scaling</span>combined with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-47' style='color:red'>pulse attacks</span>the primary pain for both economic and experience impacts – One of the key trends <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-48' style='color:red'>Radware</span>sees is around pulse attacks, whereby organizations endure <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-49' style='color:red'>multi-vector attacks</span>oscillate between <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-50' style='color:red'>volumetric and application layer</span>short periods of time that leave no room for infrastructure to recover or manual countermeasures to be formed. Think of how such burst attacks play out against auto-scaling triggers, even if the organization has DDoS technology. The technology would need to be able to detect and mitigate attacks in seconds to prevent auto-scaling triggers firing. Fleets of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-51' style='color:red'>virtual servers</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-52' style='color:red'>online</span>automatically, remaining up for a period of time and then shutting down again when load disappeared. You are left thinking about the unnecessary bills caused by mass over-provisioning – which would certainly add up. However, more seriously, what are the implications for customer experience and the management overheads for supervising services coming online and going offline in high frequency. Most organizations would expect that service goes into overdrive just once or twice a day to meet variable demand, what if that was happening +500 times a day?  The organizations I've heard about that have encountered this scenario were proud of how they fought off 48-hour attacks through the determined efforts of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-53' style='color:red'>DevOps</span>staff to keep putting plugs in the dam to limit the billing blast radius.  But into campaigns that go on much longer, the distraction for the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-54' style='color:red'>ICT</span>org is irrefutably highly problematic without highly effective DDoS mitigation technology.In summing up, cloud <span class='token pointer' id='tok-112-55' style='color:red'>computing</span>provides no assurance that inherent scalability can mitigate against DDoS attacks. The pain could be service outage, user experience degradation or unnecessary reoccurring spend and the only viable mitigation is DDoS technology that is as automated enough to cope.
