In order to get their part of the profit, the Petya authors inserted certain <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-12' style='color:red'>"protection mechanisms"</span>their malware that do not allow the unauthorized use of Petya samples. </p><p id=p195>While Ransomware-as-a-Service is not a new trend, this propagation model continues to develop, with more and more ransomware creators offering their malicious product. This approach has proved immensely appealing to criminals who lack the skills, resources or inclination to develop their own malware.  </p><p id=p239>Notable examples of ransomware that appeared in 2016 and used this model were <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-13' style='color:red'>Petya/Mischa</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-14' style='color:red'>Shark ransomware,</span>was later rebranded under the name Atom. </p><p id=p264>The growth of </p><p id=p269>In early 2017, Kaspersky Lab's researchers have discovered an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-15' style='color:red'>emerging</span>and dangerous trend: more and more <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-16' style='color:red'>cybercriminals</span>are turning their attention from attacks against private users to targeted ransomware attacks against businesses. </p><p id=p301>The attacks are primarily focused on financial organizations worldwide. Kaspersky Lab's experts have encountered cases where payment demands amounted to over half a million dollars. </p><p id=p326>The trend is alarming as ransomware <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-17' style='color:red'>actors</span>start their crusade for new and more profitable victims. There are many more potential ransomware targets in the wild, with attacks resulting in even more disastrous consequences. </p><p id=p360>The analysis in this report attempts to assess the scale of the problem, and to highlight possible reasons for the new angles of ransomware developments globally. </p><p id=p386>Main numbers </p><p id=p388>The total number of users who encountered ransomware between April 2016 and March 2017 rose by 11.4% compared to the previous 12 months (April 2015 to March 2016) – from 2,315,931 to 2,581,026 users around the world;The proportion of users who encountered ransomware at least once out of the total number of users who encountered malware fell by almost 0.8 percentage points, from 4.34% in 2015-2016 to 3.88% in 2016-2017;Among those who encountered ransomware, the proportion who encountered <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-18' style='color:red'>cryptors</span>rose by 13.6 percentage points, from 31% in 2015-2016 to 44.6% in 2016-2017;The number of users attacked with cryptors rose almost twice, from 718,536 in 2015-2016 to 1,152,299 in 2016-2017;The number of users attacked with mobile ransomware fell by 4.62% from 136,532 users in 2015-2016 to 130,232.Conclusions and predictions </p><p id=p516>Based on the statistics and trends described in this report, we have come to the following conclusions: </p><p id=p533><span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-19' style='color:red'>Ransomware</span>actors are starting to devour each other. This is a sign of growing competition between ransomware gangs.The geography statistics show that attackers switch to previously unreached countries, where users are not as well prepared for fighting ransomware, and where competition among criminals is not so high.The worrying thing here is the fact that ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly targeted, hitting financial <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-20' style='color:red'>infrastructure</span>across the globe. The reason for the trend is clear – criminals consider targeted ransomware attacks against businesses potentially more profitable than mass attacks against private users.The numbers show that ransomware on PCs are still on the rise – albeit at a slower growth rate. Moreover, the number of users attacked with mobile ransomware in the observed period fell. This could be a sign of successful collaboration between vendors of security solutions, various law enforcement agencies, and other actors. Increased threat awareness, fueled by global media coverage on the most prominent <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-21' style='color:red'>fraudulent campaigns</span>also have a part to play.Another reason is the development of joint industry efforts to protect users from encryption <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-22' style='color:red'>ransomware.Although</span>the statistics show that attacks with ransomware operate on a massive scale, responsibility for most of the mobile attacks rests with just a few groups of malware, most of them spread via affiliate programs. At the same time, PC ransomware shows quite the opposite status, with a lot of malicious actors in the wild conducting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-23' style='color:red'>ad hoc attacks.</span>with these conclusions we believe that the current ransomware threat landscape provides a good basis for several predictions on how this threat will evolve in the future. </p><p id=p796>Predictions </p><p id=p797>The extortion model is here to stay. More stable growth, which is at a higher level on average, could indicate an alarming trend: a shift from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-24' style='color:red'>chaotic and sporadic actors'</span>to gain foothold in threat landscape, to steadier and higher volumes. Given the signs of growing competition on the ransomware market, Ransomware-as-a-Service is also becoming more and more popular, attracting new actors. Ransomware is growing in sophistication and diversity, offering a lot of ready-to-go solutions to those with fewer skills, resources or time – through a growing and increasingly efficient underground <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-25' style='color:red'>ecosystem.Development</span>of criminal-to-criminal infrastructure is fueling the emergence of easy-to-go, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-26' style='color:red'>ad hoc tools</span>perform targeted attacks and extort money, making attacks more dispersed. This trend has already taken place and will likely continue in the future. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-27' style='color:red'>Global initiatives</span>protect users from encryption ransomware will keep gaining momentum.Fighting back  </p><p id=p940>Through technology: Kaspersky Lab provides a free <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-28' style='color:red'>anti-ransomware</span>tool which is available for all businesses to download and use, regardless of the security solution they have installed. </p><p id=p967>Through collaboration: The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-29' style='color:red'>No More Ransom Initiative.</span>25 July 2016, the Dutch National Police, Europol, Intel Security and Kaspersky Lab announced the launch of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-30' style='color:red'>No More Ransom project</span>a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-31' style='color:red'>non-commercial initiative</span>unites public and private organizations and aims to inform people of the dangers of ransomware and help them to recover their data. The online portal currently carries 50 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-182-32' style='color:red'>decryption tools,</span>of which were made by Kaspersky Lab. Since the NMR launch, more than 29.000 victims from all over the world have been able to unlock their files for free thanks to Kaspersky Lab tools. The NMR portal is currently available in 14 languages: English, Dutch, French, Italian and Portuguese, German, Spanish, Slovenian, Finnish, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Korean, and Japanese.
