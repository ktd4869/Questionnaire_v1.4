That's because a single piece of malware that exploits this SMB <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-32' style='color:red'>flaw</span>within a network could be used to replicate itself to all vulnerable systems very quickly. </p><p id=p189>It is this very <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-33' style='color:red'>"wormlike"</span>capability — a flaw in Microsoft's SMB service — that was harnessed for spreading by WannaCry, the global <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-34' style='color:red'>ransomware</span>contagion last month that held files for ransom at countless organizations and shut down at least 16 hospitals in the United Kingdom. </p><p id=p235>According to Microsoft, this newer SMB flaw is already being exploited in the wild.

And, as with that SMB <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-38' style='color:red'>flaw, Microsoft</span>has made the unusual decision to make fixes for this newer SMB bug available for those older versions. Users running XP or Server 2003 can get the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-39' style='color:red'>update</span>for this flaw here. </p><p id=p331>"Our decision today to release these security updates for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-40' style='color:red'>platforms</span>not in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-41' style='color:red'>should</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-42' style='color:red'>extended support</span>be viewed as a departure from our standard <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-43' style='color:red'>servicing policies,"</span>Eric Doerr, general manager of Microsoft's Security Response Center. </p><p id=p367>"Based on an assessment of the current <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-44' style='color:red'>threat</span>landscape by our <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-45' style='color:red'>security engineers,</span>made the decision to make updates available more <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-46' style='color:red'>broadly,"</span>Doerr wrote.

The vulnerability is in Windows Search only. I'm mentioning it here because a Windows user or admin thinking that turning off SMBor blocking SMB would stop all vectors to this attack would be wrong and still vulnerable without the patch. All an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-75' style='color:red'>attacker</span>needs to is get some code to talk to Windows Search in a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-44-76' style='color:red'>malformed</span>way – even locally — to exploit this Windows Search flaw.
