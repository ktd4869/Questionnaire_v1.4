Outpost24 published a blog post containing additional details on this attack on April 22. </p><p id=p228>John Stock, technology program director at Outpost24, revealed during a talk at the Infosecurity Europe 2015 conference that only one company had patched the vulnerability he and Martin Jartelius, CSO of Outpost24, reported to Honeywell this year.

The security firm believes full disclosure is not a viable approach when it comes to ICS vulnerabilities because the exploitation of such systems can have serious consequences. </p><p id=p563>Related: Learn More at the ICS Cyber Security Conference </p><p id=p572>SecurityWeek has reached out to Honeywell to find out if it has taken any steps to encourage customers to apply security updates, but the company hasn't responded by the time of publication. </p><p id=p604>Over the past year, Outpost24 has sent out a total of 20 ICS vulnerability alerts affecting the products of 15 different vendors. While Honeywell was quick to address the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-48' style='color:red'>security holes</span>by researchers, other vendors haven't been very cooperative. Stock and Jartelius told SecurityWeek that while two of the contacted vendors have confirmed working on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-49' style='color:red'>patches,</span>half a dozen companies have ignored their reports. Some vendors said they're looking into the issues, but others will not provide patches, in some cases because they believe the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-50' style='color:red'>bugs</span>are not worth patching. </p><p id=p695>"With <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-51' style='color:red'>ICS/SCADA</span>issues, fully open disclosure is not really an option, so we remain at mercy with the ability to cooperate with them," Stock told SecurityWeek. "Not all vendors treat it as seriously as they should, highlighted by the lack of response from vendors. Organisations are definitely more aware, both the media and general security <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-52' style='color:red'>posture</span>of companies proves this. However, the number of ICS/SCADA devices which are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-53' style='color:red'>internet</span>connected is still a major concern when the amount of security testing performed on these devices is highly limited." </p><p id=p783>"In an ideal world, ICS/SCADA vendors would get the security testing done themselves before release of the device. Even if they are not intended to be internet connected, the same level of security should be required if they are within an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-54' style='color:red'>internal network,"</span>added. "General security awareness also seems to be lacking around <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-55' style='color:red'>configuration</span>of the devices. The use of default passwords is always a concern, especially where it is not advised to change these in the documentation, or forced when a device is first configured. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-56' style='color:red'>Hardcoded</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-56-57' style='color:red'>credentials</span>are even worse, as this gives the user no chance to actually change the credentials." </p><p id=p887>Related: Learn More at the ICS Cyber Security Conference
