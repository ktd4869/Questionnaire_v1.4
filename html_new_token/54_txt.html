The targeted technician might read his emails from a laptop that he also connects to the operational network as part of ongoing daily activities. If the malicious URL is opened when the laptop is connected to the operational network, a malicious <span class='token pointer' id='tok-54-25' style='color:red'>JavaScript</span>snippet is executed in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-54-26' style='color:red'>victim's</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-54-27' style='color:red'>web browser</span>any network-accessible PLC that is plagued by the DoS vulnerability freezes. </p><p id=p306>CyberX told SecurityWeek that the vulnerability can also be exploited against PLCs that are accessible over the Internet. </p><p id=p324>"Once you have the destructive URL, anyone can exploit the vulnerability, this does not require a sophisticated hacker. The URL can be non-suspicious, it can even appear as an internal link, in an email message to an employee," explained Nir Giller, CTO of CyberX. "It blew our minds how simple it is.
