The group has been running campaigns, mostly in countries and territories around the South China Sea, since as early as 2012. The main targets of Spring Dragon <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-3' style='color:red'>attacks</span>are high profile governmental organizations and political parties, education institutions such as universities, as well as companies from the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-4' style='color:red'>telecommunications</span>sector. </p><p id=p63>In the beginning of 2017, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-5' style='color:red'>Kaspersky</span>Lab became aware of new activities by an APT actor we have been tracking for several years called Spring Dragon (also known as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-6' style='color:red'>LotusBlossom).</span></p><p id=p93><span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-7' style='color:red'>Information</span>about the new attacks arrived from a research partner in Taiwan and we decided to review the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-8' style='color:red'>actor's</span>tools, techniques and activities. </p><p id=p116>Using Kaspersky Lab <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-9' style='color:red'>data</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-10' style='color:red'>telemetry</span>detected the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-11' style='color:red'>malware</span>in attacks against some high-profile organizations around the South China Sea. </p><p id=p136>Spring Dragon is known for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-12' style='color:red'>spear phishing</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-13' style='color:red'>watering hole</span>and some of its tools have previously been analyzed and reported on by security researchers, including Kaspersky Lab.

This is designed to make detection more difficult. </p><p id=p296>All the backdoor modules in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-22' style='color:red'>APT's</span>toolset are capable of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-23' style='color:red'>downloading</span>more files onto the victim's machine, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-24' style='color:red'>uploading</span>files to the attacker's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-25' style='color:red'>servers,</span>and also executing any <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-26' style='color:red'>executable file</span>any command on the victim's machine. These functionalities enable the attackers to undertake different malicious activities on the victim's machine. </p><p id=p347>A detailed analysis of known malicious tools used by this threat actor is available for customers of </p><p id=p368>Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure </p><p id=p373>The main modules in Spring Dragon attacks are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-27' style='color:red'>backdoor files</span>IP addresses and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-28' style='color:red'>domain names</span>C2 servers.

The next most popular countries are the US, Germany, China and Japan. </p><p id=p511>Targets of the Attacks </p><p id=p515>As was mentioned, the Spring Dragon threat actor has been mainly targeting countries and territories around the South China Sea with a particular focus on Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand. </p><p id=p550>Our research shows that the main targets of the attacks are in the following sectors and industries: </p><p id=p567>High-profile governmental organizations Political parties Education institutions, including universitiesCompanies from the telecommunications sectorThe following map shows the geographic distribution of attacks according to our telemetry, with the frequency of the attacks increasing from yellow to red. </p><p id=p603>Geographic map of attacks </p><p id=p607>Origin of the Attacks </p><p id=p611>The victims of this threat actor have always been mainly governmental organizations and political parties. These are known to be of most interest to state-supported groups. </p><p id=p637>The type of malicious tools the actor has implemented over time are mostly backdoor files capable of stealing files from victims' systems, downloading and executing additional malware components as well as running <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-30' style='color:red'>system commands</span>victims' machines. This suggests an intention to search and manually collect information <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-31' style='color:red'>(cyberespionage).</span>This activity is most commonly associated with the interests of state-sponsored attackers. </p><p id=p697>As a routine analysis procedure, we decided to figure out the attacker's possible time zone using the malware compilation <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-32' style='color:red'>timestamps</span>from a large number of Spring Dragon samples. The following diagram shows the frequency of the timestamps during daytime hours. The timestamps range from early 2012 until now and are aligned to the GMT time zone. </p><p id=p753>Assuming the peak working hours of malware developers are the standard working day of 09:00-17:00, the chart shows that compilation took place in the GMT+8 time zone. It also suggests that either there is a second group working another shift in the same time zone or the attackers are cross-continental and there is another group, possibly in Europe. The uneven distribution of timestamps (low activity around 10am, 7-8pm UTC) suggests that the attackers didn't change the timestamps to random or constant values and they might be real. </p><p id=p840> Histogram of malware files' timestamps </p><p id=p846>Conclusions </p><p id=p847>Spring Dragon is one of many long-running APT campaigns by unknown Chinese-speaking actors. The number of malware samples which we managed to collect (over 600) for the group surpassed many others, and suggests an operation on a massive scale. It's possible that this malware <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-33' style='color:red'>toolkit</span>is offered in specialist public or private forums to any buyers, although, to date, we haven't seen this. </p><p id=p910>We believe that Spring Dragon is going to continue resurfacing regularly in the Asian region and it is therefore worthwhile having good <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-34' style='color:red'>detection mechanisms</span>as Yara rules and network <span class='token pointer' id='tok-180-35' style='color:red'>IDS</span>signatures) in place. We will continue to track this group going forward and, should the actor resurface, we will provide updates on its new modus operandi.
