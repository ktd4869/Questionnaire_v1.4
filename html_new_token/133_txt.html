Another man, Joshua Samuel Aaron, also 31, is a U.S. citizen and resident of Israel, but currently a fugitive. The Atlanta indictments referenced a third, as yet-unnamed accomplice. </p><p id=p257>Separately, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed its own charges against Shalon and Aaron, as well as a third Israeli citizen, 40-year-old Ziv Orenstein. In addition, prosecutors there announced indictments against Anthony R. Murgio, alleging he fraudulently operated the Florida-based Coin.mx Bitcoin exchange along with Shalon and through it further helped the conspiracy launder its illicit proceeds. Murgio was arrested in July 2015 and is facing prosecution in New York. </p><p id=p331>According to the Justice Department, between approximately 2007 and July 2015, Shalon owned and operated unlawful internet gambling businesses in the United States and abroad, and that he owned and operated multinational payment processors for illegal pharmaceutical suppliers, counterfeit and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-133-11' style='color:red'>("malware")</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-133-12' style='color:red'>malicious software</span>The government further alleges that Shalon owned and controlled Coin.mx, an illegal United States-based Bitcoin exchange that operated in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws. </p><p id=p400>"Through their criminal schemes, between in or about 2007 and in or about July 2015, Shalon and his co-conspirators earned hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds, of which Shalon concealed at least $100 million in Swiss and other bank accounts," reads a statement issued by Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. </p><p id=p459>The government alleges that Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein operated their criminal schemes and laundered their criminal proceeds through at least 75 shell companies and bank and brokerage accounts around the world.  "The defendants controlled these companies and accounts using aliases, and by fraudulently using approximately 200 purported identification documents, including over 30 false passports that purported to be issued by the United States and at least 16 other countries," the Justice Department wrote. </p><p id=p532>The indictments charge that the defendants orchestrated a complex scheme to acquire substantial stakes in targeted companies, buying up large amounts of (low-priced) stocks. The government says the conspiracy tried to capitalize on price changes in those stocks prompted by events allegedly set in motion by the accused — such as so-called <span class='token pointer' id='tok-133-13' style='color:red'>"reverse mergers"</span>shell companies that the men alleged set up, or via spam <span class='token pointer' id='tok-133-14' style='color:red'>email blasts</span>customer lists stolen from the hacked brokerage firms that falsely touted the stocks in a bid to trick others into buying it. </p><p id=p621>Authorities say Murgio and Shalon tricked banks and credit card issuers into authorizing debit and credit card payment transactions to purchase Bitcoins through Coin.mx, by deliberately miscoding customer transactions as something else — such as purchases for wedding dresses and pet supply stores. Prosecutors also allege that Murgio and Shalon paid a small credit union in New Jersey $100,000 to install one of his co-conspirators on the bank's board of directors. </p><p id=p692>If all of this sounds like the script of a Hollywood movie, it should be a familiar script by now.
