<p id=p0>For those of us tasked with managing, storing and securing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-0' style='color:red'>information,</span>it's difficult to imagine <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-1' style='color:red'>automation will assume these roles.</span>recent years, much of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-2' style='color:red'>angst</span>over labor-replacing automation has primarily been focused on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-3' style='color:red'>manufacturing,</span>and for good reason. The International <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-4' style='color:red'>Federation</span>of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-5' style='color:red'>Robotics</span>says the auto industry is "the most important <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-6' style='color:red'>customer"</span>for industrial robots, buying almost 40 percent of total global output of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-7' style='color:red'>machines.</span></p><p id=p68><span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-8' style='color:red'>Gartner</span>attempts to address the question, "Which Robot-proof Jobs Should My Kids Major In?", but comes to the conclusion that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-9' style='color:red'>"technology</span>can change any <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-10' style='color:red'>occupation."</span></p><p id=p93>Apprehension about worker displacement in fields far from physical manufacturing is growing due to improving <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-11' style='color:red'>artificial</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-12' style='color:red'>intelligence</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-13' style='color:red'>(AI).</span>Mark <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-14' style='color:red'>Cuban,</span>speaking at <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-15' style='color:red'>SXSW</span>in March of this year, expressed concern that white-collar jobs are at risk.

He comes to the conclusion that, "if you think you can do security well without security people, you are so deluded – and probably breached too." He goes on to say that "force <span class='token pointer' id='tok-171-45' style='color:red'>augmentation"</span>is really how to look at service providers. </p><p id=p501>Challenges finding qualified security staff are going to drive continued interest in outsourcing certain security practices – monitoring and first response being the obvious choices, but those MSSPs that can leverage AI as a force multiplier will be able to offer better services and lower costs.  </p><p id=p547>Getting ready for the changes to security driven by automation </p><p id=p557>Whether we like it or not, automation will play an ever-increasing role in IT security.
