Within this model, he sees the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-11' style='color:red'>tech industry</span>'a neutral Digital Switzerland' occupying the role of the Red Cross. It is a popularized re-working of arguments presented By Scott Charney's June 2016 paper, An organizing model for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-12' style='color:red'>cybersecurity</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-13' style='color:red'>norms</span>development. </p><p id=p117>Smith also spoke on the topic at this week's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-14' style='color:red'>RSA</span>Conference in San Francisco. </p><p id=p130>Smith believes that the time is right. "Just as the world's governments came together in 1949 to adopt the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect civilians in times of war, we need a Digital Geneva Convention that will commit governments to implement the norms that have been developed to protect civilians on the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-15' style='color:red'>internet</span>in times of peace."  </p><p id=p187>Key to this idea will be an international adoption of norms; that is, shared expectations of appropriate behavior. Various organizations have been working on such norms. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-16' style='color:red'>US-Sino</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-17' style='color:red'>bilateral</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-18' style='color:red'>agreement</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-19' style='color:red'>"UN GGE, G20,</span>have worked toward shaping the appropriate and mutually agreed-upon behavior in the digital <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-20' style='color:red'>domain,"</span>explains Andrea Limbago, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-21' style='color:red'>Endgame</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-22' style='color:red'>Chief Social Scientist at</span>formerly Senior <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-23' style='color:red'>Technical Lead</span>the Joint Warfare </p><p id=p253>"Are we at the beginning of a sea change in what the international community decides is acceptable behavior?" asked Jeff Moss, founder of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-24' style='color:red'>Black Hat</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-25' style='color:red'>DEF CON</span>September, 2016. "It doesn't have to be a treaty; it can just be a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-26' style='color:red'>norm.</span>The next administration is going to have to drive those norms of behavior." </p><p id=p310>But Brad Smith goes to the next step. He is arguing for just such an international treaty loosely modelled on the Fourth Geneva Convention. Is such a treaty feasible? It would require the international adoption of norms of behavior, coupled with the ability to definitively attribute wrongdoing. </p><p id=p357>Norms </p><p id=p358>Smith explains that the norms underpinning his convention "should commit governments to avoiding cyber-attacks that target the private sector or critical infrastructure or the use of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-27' style='color:red'>hacking</span>to steal <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-28' style='color:red'>intellectual property.</span>it should require that governments assist private sector efforts to detect, contain, respond to and recover from these events, and should mandate that governments report <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-29' style='color:red'>vulnerabilities</span>to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-30' style='color:red'>vendors</span>rather than stockpile, sell or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-31' style='color:red'>exploit</span>them." </p><p id=p425>The first two elements are uncontroversial: governments should not attack other nations, and governments should assist the private sector in recovering from such attacks. The third, however, is difficult: it commits governments to effective cyber weapon disarmament. </p><p id=p462>The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-32' style='color:red'>US/China</span>bilateral agreement in late 2015 is cited as the green shoots of norms development. The two countries "made important progress in 2015 to ban intellectual property <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-33' style='color:red'>cyber-theft."</span>Noticeably, however, while <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-34' style='color:red'>commercial espionage was</span>political <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-35' style='color:red'>espionage</span>was omitted. Smith's norms, however, would effectively neutralize government agencies' ability to hack and spy. </p><p id=p515>The US/China agreement ultimately led to several countries, including the US, voluntarily adopting 'norms of state behavior in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-36' style='color:red'>cyberspace',</span>explains Fortinet CISO Phil Quade, who previously served as Chief of the National Security Agency (NSA) <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-37' style='color:red'>Cyber Task Force.</span>norms," he explains, "helped to establish guidelines like not stealing intellectual property for commercial gain, not attacking critical infrastructure, not using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-38' style='color:red'>CERTs</span>for offensive actions, and cooperating with government law enforcement in their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-39' style='color:red'>cybercrime</span>investigations." But, he added, they are "designed to exclude government <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-40' style='color:red'>intelligence</span>activities." </p><p id=p599>"Nation states have invested too much time, attention and money into cyber warfare and espionage machines to turn back the dial," warns Eric O'Neill, currently Carbon Black's National Security Strategist, but formerly a member of the FBI's Special <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-41' style='color:red'>Surveillance</span>Group. It is unlikely that governments will include themselves in the norms they might otherwise endorse. </p><p id=p654><span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-42' style='color:red'>Attribution </span></p><p id=p655>Accurate <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-43' style='color:red'>attribution</span>is essential for the effective operation of norms. Without it, there would be nothing to stop individual nations flouting them with impunity. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-44' style='color:red'>"Cyberespionage,"</span>says O'Neill, "relies on the difficulty of attribution, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-45' style='color:red'>anonymity,</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-46' style='color:red'>ease of access from</span>in the world. When the U.S. has caught Russia, North Korea, Iran and China spying, probing our critical infrastructure, attacking our business, and stealing our <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-47' style='color:red'>data,</span>each country staunchly denied the acts." </p><p id=p727>Put simply, irrefutable technical attribution is impossible. But based on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-48' style='color:red'>accumulative</span>intelligence – from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-49' style='color:red'>SIGINT,</span>field agents, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-50' style='color:red'>geopolitical</span>analysis and more – one nation's intelligence community can definitively attribute attackers – but only to its own government. It will not reveal full information on its methods of attribution to foreign countries, leaving continuing room for doubt. </p><p id=p783>Smith's, and indeed, Charney's, solution is an independent international committee of experts. "In addition," wrote Smith, "a Digital Geneva Convention needs to create an independent organization that spans the public and private sectors. Specifically, the world needs an independent organization that can investigate and share publicly the evidence that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-51' style='color:red'>attributes</span>nation-state attacks to specific countries."  </p><p id=p837>There are two problems here: firstly, can such an organization succeed in genuine attribution without full intelligence community cooperation; and secondly, will all nations accept that attribution? "I think the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-52' style='color:red'>logistics</span>that would need to be involved to somehow accurately <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-53' style='color:red'>monitor</span>and identify who is doing what to who is nearly impossible," comments Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-54' style='color:red'>AsTech;</span>"especially considering the ease in which a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-55' style='color:red'>malicious actor</span>hide, obfuscate, redirect, bluff and otherwise mislead where they're performing attacks from. For an organization like this to be successful, accurate proof which all parties involved can agree is correct would be the key. But the very nature of technology today would make that difficult at best. And even if you can monitor all <span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-56' style='color:red'>traffic</span>accurately, there would still be difficulty in getting the political factions involved to agree with the findings." </p><p id=p979><span class='token pointer' id='tok-17-57' style='color:red'>Cyber</span>Geneva Convention </p><p id=p982>A cyber Geneva Convention (that is, the formalization of agreed norms and accurate attribution into a binding international treaty) seems unlikely. Even beyond attribution, how do you sanction nations that have flouted the norms? As Phil Quade comments, "Rogue governments tend not to pay much attention to 'norms of behavior'." </p><p id=p1032>A treaty would require teeth. "Any plausible Cyber Geneva Convention would require agreement on sanctions for a nation member that violates the convention," says O'Neill. "Because attribution is extraordinarily difficult, these penalties may lack teeth if the convention cannot enforce them."
