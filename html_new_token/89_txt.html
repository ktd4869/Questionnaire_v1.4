Joining us to add his voice to the mix is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-5' style='color:red'>ESET</span>Malware Researcher Lukáš Štefanko </p><p id=p35>Yesterday, we reviewed a few possible <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-6' style='color:red'>implications</span>of the Epic Games decision to snub Google Play and, instead, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-7' style='color:red'>distribute</span>the Android version of its wildly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-8' style='color:red'>popular</span>game, Fortnite, solely through its own epicgames.com <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-9' style='color:red'>website.</span>How to make sure the move isn't a boon to all manner of scammers? We've now <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-10' style='color:red'>caught</span>up with Lukáš to ask for his take on threats faced by Fortnite's players, both current and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-11' style='color:red'>potential.</span>Read what he has to say. </p><p id=p110>Perhaps most importantly, what advice would you give to Fortnite players to stay safe? </p><p id=p124>Normally, I would urge everybody to stick to Google Play, but for obvious reasons this doesn't help in this case. The crucial thing here is to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-12' style='color:red'>download</span>Fortnite's Android app only from Epic's website and, once you <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-13' style='color:red'>install</span>it, make sure that you <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-14' style='color:red'>immediately</span>revoke the permission to install apps from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-15' style='color:red'>sources".</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-16' style='color:red'>"unknown</span>will reduce your risk of downloading malware in the future. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-17' style='color:red'>Under no circumstances</span>you download the app or what is, in fact, likely to be its malicious imposter, from non-official app stores, torrents, or other shady sources. </p><p id=p216>Let's size up the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-18' style='color:red'>threat</span>now. Just how much of a problem does Epic Games' move represent? </p><p id=p233>Put simply, the way in which the game is installed increases the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-19' style='color:red'>susceptibility of users</span>a device <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-20' style='color:red'>compromise,</span>be it due to their installing a fake app from an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-21' style='color:red'>unofficial source</span>forgetting to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-22' style='color:red'>disable</span>the "unknown sources" option once Fortnite is installed. </p><p id=p277>Did you see this coming? Did you expect that a massively popular app would, one day, sidestep Google Play? </p><p id=p296>Honestly, no. On the other hand, I fully understand that major app developers with massive player bases might want to trigger a bit of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-23' style='color:red'>"shake-up", especially</span>that Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-24' style='color:red'>referred to Google Play's</span>transaction fee (levied against the vendor) as a "store tax". But for the sake of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-25' style='color:red'>security,</span>I hope other app developers don't follow in Epic's footsteps. </p><p id=p362>Threats come in many different shades and hues, but is there any one kind of threat that Fortnite's players should be particularly wary of? </p><p id=p386><span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-26' style='color:red'>Malicious YouTube videos</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-27' style='color:red'>promise</span>extra game <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-28' style='color:red'>features</span>or giveaways and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-29' style='color:red'>prompt</span>gamers to download apps that purport to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-30' style='color:red'>complement</span>Fortnite, but whose effects are malicious rather than beneficial. </p><p id=p415>How exactly can things go awry for users? </p><p id=p423>For example, victims can end up with fake apps that spy on them, steal their Fortnite accounts, add unexplained charges to their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-31' style='color:red'>bills by sending premium-rate</span>messages on their behalf, or lure them into completing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-32' style='color:red'>"surveys"</span>that request their personal information. Fortnite has been so popular, and the Android version so <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-33' style='color:red'>highly anticipated,</span>attackers can sneak any malicious code you can think of into the unofficial app. Which is also why a robust security app can go a long way towards enhancing your defenses. </p><p id=p509>What are the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-34' style='color:red'>telltale</span>signs of an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-35' style='color:red'>infection</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-36' style='color:red'>post-installation?</span></p><p id=p518>The most common way to identify a scammy app is noticing that as soon as it is launched, it <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-37' style='color:red'>disappears</span>from the victim's view. This is not to say that the app has been removed; it's just hidden from the victim's view and operates in the background, in which case it can do sneaky things without your being aware of them. </p><p id=p579>What's the usual chain of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-38' style='color:red'>events</span>after someone takes the bait and, say, clicks on a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-39' style='color:red'>dodgy</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-40' style='color:red'>link?</span></p><p id=p597>First of all, the lead-up to the compromise evokes trust and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-41' style='color:red'>installation</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-42' style='color:red'>imitates the</span>for the bona fide app. After clicking on a link to the purported Fortnite app, you're redirected to a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-43' style='color:red'>lookalike</span>version of the legitimate website, and you're prompted to download the app's latest version. When you download the installer, you need to install the app manually, but not before <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-44' style='color:red'>changing</span>the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-45' style='color:red'>device's</span>settings and permitting app installations from unknown sources. That's it. If the app was malicious, your device is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-46' style='color:red'>compromised.</span></p><p id=p683>What should you do after realizing that your device has been compromised with malware? </p><p id=p697>You need to locate the app in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-47' style='color:red'>Manager.</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-48' style='color:red'>App</span>this is often easier said than done, as the app may not be called Fortnite at all there, since it might impersonate other apps, including system apps. A better way to counter the threat is to install security software. </p><p id=p746>Where does the user's responsibility for staying safe lie? </p><p id=p755>Users are responsible for checking whether an app on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-49' style='color:red'>Google Play is genuine,</span>example by reading user reviews or going through the app's description and comments. That way, they see a bigger picture and can decide for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-50' style='color:red'>themselves</span>if an app is safe for download or if they should choose another one. </p><p id=p808>What are your thoughts about Google Play security in general? </p><p id=p818>Our own research has shown multiple times that Google Play's built-in protections aren't <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-51' style='color:red'>impregnable.</span>Having said that, although the store isn't a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-52' style='color:red'>"Fort Knox of security",</span>does a good job of fighting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-89-53' style='color:red'>harmful apps,</span>if such an app is detected, they remove it promptly.
