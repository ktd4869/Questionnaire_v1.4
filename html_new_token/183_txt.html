This is what has made Necurs <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-30' style='color:red'>stealthy</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-31' style='color:red'>covert.</span></p><p id=p224>Below are the main <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-32' style='color:red'>modules</span>of Necurs: </p><p id=p231>The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-33' style='color:red'>Module:</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-34' style='color:red'>Spam</span>is the main <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-35' style='color:red'>module</span>of Necurs. It is used to conduct <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-36' style='color:red'>malicious attacks</span>target computers. From this module, there are several ways in which Necurs has been <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-37' style='color:red'>deployed,</span>one of the most famous <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-38' style='color:red'>delivery mechanisms</span>that of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-39' style='color:red'>Locky</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-40' style='color:red'>ransomware.</span></p><p id=p277><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-41' style='color:red'>Proxy Module:</span>module adds <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-42' style='color:red'>traffic redirection</span>the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-43' style='color:red'>HTTPS</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-44' style='color:red'>protocols.</span></p><p id=p291><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-45' style='color:red'>DDoS</span>Module: This module was added in February 2017. It allows for every <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-46' style='color:red'>bot</span>to conduct a DDoS attack on any selected target. As the present time, there has been no DDoS attack conducted by Necurs; but if it were to occur, it would have a significant impact worldwide. </p><p id=p340>Below is a summary of the roles which have been undertaken by Necurs since its inception: </p><p id=p356><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-47' style='color:red'>Training</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-48' style='color:red'>Ethical Hacking</span>Resources <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-49' style='color:red'>(InfoSec)</span></p><p id=p362>Necurs was initiated by creating a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-50' style='color:red'>peer to peer network with</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-51' style='color:red'>.bit</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-52' style='color:red'>domain extension.</span>gave the evolving botnet the advantage to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-53' style='color:red'>evade</span>detection and to be part of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-54' style='color:red'>decentralized</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-55' style='color:red'>DNS</span>system. In 2013, Necurs leveraged the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-56' style='color:red'>Upatre</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-57' style='color:red'>loader</span>to create the initial infection. Then, it used the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-58' style='color:red'>Gameover Zeus</span>for subsequent attacks. Eventually, they were neutralized by the security community. However, before this happened, Necurs also became associated with Ransomware, such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-59' style='color:red'>CryptoLocker.</span>In 2015, Necurs continued delivering its various forms of ransomware, one of the prime examples being that of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-60' style='color:red'>Cryptowall.</span>In 2016, Necurs initiated various <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-61' style='color:red'>spam</span>campaigns that were launched by some of the significant <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-62' style='color:red'>Cyber attacker groups</span>as TeslaCrypt, NeverQuest, and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-63' style='color:red'>Dridex.</span>During this timeframe, Necurs also started to distribute the Locky Ransomware. It is believed that it is still present on over 50,000 machines. In March 2017, Necurs launched a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-64' style='color:red'>"pump and dump scam"</span>scam for very low valued stocks. The result was that the trading volume for these stocks went much higher than normal. The Latest infection from Necurs is the exploitation of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-65' style='color:red'>DDE</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-66' style='color:red'>vulnerability</span>and delivering that through the Locky Ransomware. To infect, initially, the victim computer will <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-67' style='color:red'>receive</span>a "malspam" from the Necurs botnet. It contains an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-68' style='color:red'>infected.DOC</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-69' style='color:red'>attachment</span>that further <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-70' style='color:red'>exploits</span>the DDE. Second, after the execution has taken place, the 1st stage malware is then downloaded. This stage consists of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-71' style='color:red'>HTTP</span>requests with the returning <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-72' style='color:red'>URL</span>of the malware. Third, the first stage malware then sends over 2 HTTP <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-73' style='color:red'>posts requests</span>download Locky <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-74' style='color:red'>binary</span>that makes up the Ransomware. </p><p id=p629>Necurs has resiliency built into it, and the following are its characteristics: </p><p id=p641>Necurs possesses a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-75' style='color:red'>modular architecture,</span>it consists of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-76' style='color:red'>kernel-mode</span>rootkit. As a result, it is difficult to remove. This allows for Necurs to disable any security solutions features on the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-77' style='color:red'>end-host.Necurs</span>currently uses 2 sets of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-78' style='color:red'>DGAs.</span>These are used to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-79' style='color:red'>generate</span>2048 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-80' style='color:red'>domains</span>that cover 48 different <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-81' style='color:red'>TLDs.Necurs</span>also has some <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-82' style='color:red'>Anti-Analysis Techniques.</span>example, it can detect if it is being executed inside a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-83' style='color:red'>virtual environment.</span>the binary has been established, it will then use the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-84' style='color:red'>DGA</span>to generate 4 random domains in an attempt to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-85' style='color:red'>resolve</span>them. If it can do this, it will then ascertain that it is indeed inside a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-86' style='color:red'>virtual environment.All</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-87' style='color:red'>malicious payloads</span>are transferred by Necurs are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-88' style='color:red'>encrypted</span>and in a binary, thus making them difficult to detect.Finally, Necurs is the catalyst behind many of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-89' style='color:red'>Cyber-attacks</span>that take place. The result is a catastrophe for businesses and corporations regarding lost revenues and customers. Further, it is expected that Necurs will become much more sophisticated, and thus will be the tool of choice for future <span class='token pointer' id='tok-183-90' style='color:red'>Cybercrimes,</span>especially where Ransomware is involved.
