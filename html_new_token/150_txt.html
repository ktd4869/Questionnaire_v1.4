In this Q&A, we sat down with Bryce to discuss <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-4' style='color:red'>security</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-5' style='color:red'>awareness</span>training strategies and best practices that other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-6' style='color:red'>infosec</span>leaders can apply to their own training <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-7' style='color:red'>programs.</span>  </p><p id=p44>Many infosec leaders struggle to capture buy-in for security awareness initiatives. What advice can you share with others to help overcome this challenge? Austin: Any awareness training <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-8' style='color:red'>program</span>must be real and relatable — it can't exist in a vacuum. Teaching cybersecurity from an academic <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-9' style='color:red'>standpoint</span>is pointless. You must use real-world examples to show how your employees' personal lives can be affected by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-10' style='color:red'>cyber threats,</span>also how they can be improved through <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-11' style='color:red'>cyber-secure</span>behavior. You then must link those same benefits to the business. This approach will ground security awareness lessons in their hearts, as well as their heads. </p><p id=p145>How do you engage executive teams in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-12' style='color:red'>security awareness training program</span>as well as encourage their participation in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-13' style='color:red'>training?Austin:</span>The best way to engage executive-level teams in security awareness training is to translate the risk of human error from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-14' style='color:red'>phishing</span>and other threats into tangible business risk. I like to discuss relatable impacts from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-15' style='color:red'>breaches,</span>like the 25% stock devaluation that happened at Equifax following their 2017 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-16' style='color:red'>breach.</span>There are several CEOs who have experienced "resume-generating events" as a result of a cybersecurity incident — these types of examples will get your executive team's attention.   </p><p id=p243>Executives are especially focused on these two areas: </p><p id=p251>The bottom line of their company The trajectory of their careersWhen you place cybersecurity threats in the context of business or career risk, executives are much more likely to support security awareness training initiatives at their organizations.  </p><p id=p289>In terms of getting executives to complete training themselves, it's important for us to reinforce the idea that company culture starts with the executive team. Executives have more impact on the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-17' style='color:red'>mindsets</span>of their employees than anyone else in the company. If they don't complete the training, no one else will.  </p><p id=p341>How can you ensure your training program meets <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-18' style='color:red'>compliance</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-19' style='color:red'>requirements?Austin:</span>Security awareness training compliance requirements vary widely from industry-to-industry and country-to-country. It is not one-size-fits-all. The goal is the same, but the methodology used to achieve compliance can be completely different.  </p><p id=p383>You must do one of two things: </p><p id=p390>Hire outside expertise to interpret compliance needs and establish a security awareness training program to meet those needs. Have an internal compliance team dedicated to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-20' style='color:red'>disseminating</span>training needs and creating a compliant training program suitable for your company. You must treat this process the same way you would treat any other compliance audit. I advise my clients to fully understand what the real risks of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-21' style='color:red'>non-compliance</span>are and how much risk exposure they have.  </p><p id=p465>What training frequency do you <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-22' style='color:red'>recommend?Austin:</span>I've seen many <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-23' style='color:red'>companies</span>do awareness training annually — do not do this. Security awareness training must be ongoing and continuous. If possible, there should be at least one event a week. This can be a planned phishing campaign, a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-24' style='color:red'>USB attack</span>a staged insider attack. And then we must educate users what to do if they see a suspicious email or other threat.  </p><p id=p537>How targeted should training be (by employee level, role, etc.)? Does targeting training improve <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-25' style='color:red'>effectiveness?Austin:</span>A lot of security awareness training is identical regardless of role. Knowing what a phishing email looks like is something everyone needs to understand. The same applies to USB drives in the parking lot or other physical security best practices.  </p><p id=p593>I like to target training by level of system access. This usually falls into two categories: </p><p id=p609>Access to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-26' style='color:red'>sensitive data:</span>they have access to big chunks of sensitive data? If so, that user must receive rigorous training regardless of role. Access to money: Do they have the ability to initiate wire transfers for ACH? Those people are being <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-27' style='color:red'>spearphished</span>directly and actively. They need a much higher level of training as well. How should security awareness training be delivered? Austin: Security awareness training must follow a multifaceted approach and become a part of company culture. I recommend involving the marketing team to build excitement about secure behavior and help sell it internally.  </p><p id=p707>Everyone has different learning styles, which requires a diverse approach. Here are a few different tactics to consider using in your next training campaign: </p><p id=p731><span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-28' style='color:red'>Gamification</span>and incentives (gift cards for reported emails)In-person presentations and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-29' style='color:red'>kick-off</span>eventsComputer-based simulationsHow do you track end-user behavioral changes over <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-30' style='color:red'>time?Austin:</span>My preferred Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is the number of reported potential cybersecurity incidents per employee, over a set period of time. These include reported phishing emails and fraudulent wire transfer requests. If that number increases, your program is working.  </p><p id=p793>If you have more than 1,000 employees and you can't track the number of reported incidents per month by the dozens, something is wrong.  </p><p id=p818>What impact has security awareness training had on your clients' organizations? What are the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-31' style='color:red'>benefits?Austin:</span>Security awareness training is one of the foundations of a strong security program — its value cannot be overestimated. I have seen companies not only have fewer breaches as a result of a cybersecurity program, but also lower loss rates on company-owned laptops and smartphones. Security awareness training teaches people how to care for and protect their devices. Not leaving them in their car is part of the training. I've also seen clients detect problems in process before they become actual problems. </p><p id=p915>Any final advice for our readers? Austin: A good security awareness training program can make your job as a technologist much easier. It's a small investment that can return dividends.  </p><p id=p946>For example, a well-developed training program can help you justify your budget requests. When the CEO understands the risks of things like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-32' style='color:red'>ransomware,</span>you're much more likely to receive support for purchases intended as a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-33' style='color:red'>countermeasure,</span>e.g., establishing a physical backup system. Security awareness training will pre-sell the need for your cybersecurity budget requests.  </p><p id=p1001>About Bryce Austin </p><p id=p1004>Bryce Austin started his <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-34' style='color:red'>technology</span>career on a Commodore 64 computer and a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-150-35' style='color:red'>cassette tape drive.</span>he is a leading voice on emerging technology and cybersecurity issues.
