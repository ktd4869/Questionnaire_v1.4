<p id=p0>Microsoft <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-0' style='color:red'>today</span>issued security <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-1' style='color:red'>updates</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-2' style='color:red'>to</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-3' style='color:red'>fix</span>at least 19 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-4' style='color:red'>vulnerabilities</span>in its software, including a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-5' style='color:red'>zero-day</span>flaw in Internet Explorer <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-6' style='color:red'>browser</span>that is already being actively <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-7' style='color:red'>exploited.</span>Separately, Adobe has <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-8' style='color:red'>released</span>a critical update that plugs at least two security holes in its <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-9' style='color:red'>Flash Player</span></p><p id=p47>Three of the eight <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-10' style='color:red'>patches</span>that Microsoft released earned its most dire "critical" label, meaning the vulnerabilities fixed in them can be exploited by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-11' style='color:red'>malware</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-12' style='color:red'>miscreants</span>remotely without any help from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-13' style='color:red'>Windows</span>users. Among the critical patches is an update for Internet Explorer (MS13-088) that mends at least two holes in the default Windows browser (including <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-14' style='color:red'>IE</span>11). MS13-089 is a critical file handling flaw present in virtually every supported version of Windows. </p><p id=p121>The final critical <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-15' style='color:red'>patch</span>— MS13-090 — fixes essentially another IE flaw <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-16' style='color:red'>(ActiveX)</span>that showed up <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-17' style='color:red'>in targeted</span>attacks late last week. Microsoft says attackers used a second, "information disclosure" <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-18' style='color:red'>vulnerability</span>in tandem with the ActiveX flaw, but that the company is still investigating that one. It noted that its Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) tool successfully blocked the ActiveX exploit. </p><p id=p180><span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-19' style='color:red'>Nevertheless,</span>it's important for IE users to apply these updates as quickly as possible. According to Rapid7, exploit code for the ActiveX vulnerability appeared on Pastebin this morning. </p><p id=p207>"It was known to be under some targeted exploitation, but that will <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-20' style='color:red'>probably expand</span>now that the exploit is public," said Ross Barrett, senior manager of security engineering at Rapid7. "I would call patching this issue priority #1." For what it's worth, Microsoft agrees, at least according to this suggested patch <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-21' style='color:red'>deployment</span>chart. </p><p id=p253>Today's patch batch from Redmond did not include an official patch for yet another zero-day vulnerability that has been under active exploitation, although Microsoft did release a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-22' style='color:red'>stopgap</span>Fix-It tool last week to help blunt the threat. The company also is once again advising Windows users to take another look at EMET. </p><p id=p304>Check out Microsoft's Technet <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-23' style='color:red'>blog</span>for more information on these and other updates that the company released today. </p><p id=p322>In a separate patch release, Adobe issued a fix for its Flash Player software for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android devices. The Flash update brings the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-24' style='color:red'>ubiquitous</span>player to v. 11.9.900.152 on Mac and Windows systems. Users browsing the Web with IE10 or IE11 on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-25' style='color:red'>Windows 8.x</span>get the new version of Flash (11.9.900.152) automatically; IE users not on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-26' style='color:red'>Windows 8</span>need to update manually if Flash is not set to auto-update. </p><p id=p396>To check which version of Flash you have installed, visit this page. Direct links to the various Flash installers are available here. Be aware that downloading Flash Player from Adobe's recommended spot — this page — often includes add-ons, security scanners or other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-27' style='color:red'>crud</span>you probably don't want. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-28' style='color:red'>Strangely</span>enough, when I visited that page today with IE10 , the download included a pre-checked box to install Google Toolbar and to switch my default browser to Google <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-29' style='color:red'>Chrome.</span></p><p id=p474>Speaking of Chrome, it's high time to address a sore spot for me these past few months. When Chrome first began shipping <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-30' style='color:red'>auto-updates</span>for Flash, Google often quietly fixed new Flash vulnerabilities in its browser even before Adobe issued its patch advisories — sometimes days in advance. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-31' style='color:red'>Increasingly</span>over the past year, however, Google has lagged behind in this department. In September 2013, for example, it took Google more than a week to update its browser to fix the latest Flash flaws, leaving users dangerously exposed. A Google spokesperson attributed that one-week delay to "a bug in Chrome on Windows 8 Metro" that prompted the Google to "halt the update" while it investigated the root cause. But the company never fully explained why the rollout of that Flash update was suspended for users on other versions of Windows. </p><p id=p611>I'm happy to see that Chrome appears to be back on its game: the latest version of Chrome (31.0.1650.48) includes this Flash update (v. 11.9.900.152). If you're using Chrome and see the latest version, you may simply need to close and restart the browser. </p><p id=p655>Finally, while Adobe says it is not aware of any exploits or active attacks against either of the Flash flaws, the company may have fixed something of a zero-day today. Among the other patches Adobe released is a set of fixes <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-32' style='color:red'>for ColdFusion,</span>its <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-33' style='color:red'>Web application</span>long ago, researcher Alex Holden of Hold <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-34' style='color:red'>Security</span>pinged Adobe that the same attackers who stole the company's source code for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-35' style='color:red'>ColdFusion,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-36' style='color:red'>Acrobat,</span>Reader and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-37' style='color:red'>Photoshop</span>also were using a zero-day flaw in ColdFusion which, according to Adobe may result in access files remotely without authorization. That flaw was one of two vulnerabilities that Adobe fixed in today's updates for ColdFusion. </p><p id=p762>Holden maintains this flaw was being used by attackers prior to today. "Hold Security identified an attack attempt against a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-38' style='color:red'>ColdFusion version 8</span>by the same hackers behind breaches like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-41-39' style='color:red'>LexisNexis,</span>Adobe, and others," Holden said. "Unaware of the possible effectiveness of this attack, Hold Security reached out to Adobe. While Adobe did not find the precise attack effective against any of supported CF versions, they did identify a critical flaw in the same resource which led to the patch issued today. </p><p id=p845>For its part, Adobe says they are unaware of any zero-day attacks against the now-patched vulnerability, and that the vulnerability they credited Holden with fixing was present only in ColdFusion version 10.
