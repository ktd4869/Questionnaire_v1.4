As they noted in August 2014: </p><p id=p133>The idea of using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-14' style='color:red'>network</span>micro-segmentation to limit lateral traffic isn't new, but until recently, it was never feasible. Even if you blanketed your data center with a legion of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-15' style='color:red'>hardware firewalls,</span>be no way to operationalize them, and the costs would be astronomical. Until now.  </p><p id=p180>A purely <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-16' style='color:red'>network-centric approach</span>micro-segmentation cannot operate at scale or deliver complete data center and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-17' style='color:red'>service-chaining,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-18' style='color:red'>Traffic steering,</span>requiring proprietary network operations falls apart in today's dynamic, distributed, heterogeneous and distributed <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-19' style='color:red'>computing operations.</span>proprietary network chokepoint/enforcement point model re-introduces the complexity of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-20' style='color:red'>client server technology</span>the cloud world. When a vendor talks about throughput in the context of security in today's hybrid cloud world, they are reaching for the past, not the future. </p><p id=p259>The big "aha" for security and networking teams is not that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-21' style='color:red'>segmentation</span>will support better <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-22' style='color:red'>data center hygiene –</span>already knew that. What is different is that network segmentation is related to, security segmentation, but is not the same. While network segmentation and security segmentation both introduce forms of isolation, they were built for different purposes: </p><p id=p316>● <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-23' style='color:red'>Network segmentation</span>designed initially to create smaller <span class='token pointer' id='tok-125-24' style='color:red'>networks (subnets)</span>reduce performance considerations such as layer 2 broadcast storm, and then later to create isolation.

Network devices do a good job of coarse grain, micro-segmentation, not only for the perimeter, but for well-defined zones that include environmental separation in relatively static and well-defined boundaries.  </p><p id=p492>Where networking fails – and this includes the network stack in the hypervisor or containers – is where you need the more granular security segmentation of micro-segmentation. As you move to ringfence applications, tiers of applications or individual workloads, the network and hypervisor model both lacks the context and the flexibility to do the job. What happens if an application spans several data centers? Would you hairpin traffic back to an enforcement point? Even worse, what happens when some organizations have dozens and dozens of data centers that support a single application? </p><p id=p584>While the network- and hypervisor-centric versions of micro-segmentation do a fine job of "micro-segmentation" (i.e., read environmental segmentation), they then become complex and operationally stultified when you move to true micro-segmentation. </p><p id=p615>This becomes self-evident as we move to the need to segment processes or individual ports at the workload or container level. How would you use a network to segment across 10,000 dynamic ports in Active Directory?
