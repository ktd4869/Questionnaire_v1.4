Because the volume is so high, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-2' style='color:red'>phishers</span>need only a few people to click to be successful.

In this article we'll talk about what a phishing filter does and how to set one up. </p><p id=p106>Enter the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-8' style='color:red'>Phishing FilterTo</span>with the tsunami of phishing attacks, filters have been developed to divert or neutralize these emails. The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-9' style='color:red'>suspicious</span>emails are sometimes placed in a special inbox or flagged and stripped of their attachments and links. Users or admins can then examine its contents more carefully. </p><p id=p156>Additionally, web browsers have their own type of phishing filter. When you click on a link, Firefox, Chrome or whatever browser you use will often automatically load the document or website. For regular sites, this helps make the Internet a pleasurable experience. However, if the site is malicious, you could be opening yourself up to a world of trouble. You could enter your credentials which could be stolen, or, if you are using a browser or program that is not up-to-date or has some kind of vulnerability your computer could be infected by a virus. </p><p id=p251>  </p><p id=p252>A browser phishing filter examines these redirects more closely. It could compare the URL to a blacklist of phishing sites, or analyze the link for Cyrillic or swapped <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-10' style='color:red'>characters</span>that make it appear real (e.g. using an uppercase "I" instead of a lowercase "l"). </p><p id=p296>If there is a match to the database, the browser will instead load a warning page that the website may harm your computer or steal your information. </p><p id=p323>An example of a phishing filter in Chrome </p><p id=p331>Of course, as in any game of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-11' style='color:red'>cat-and-mouse,</span>thieves are constantly learning to bypass these filters in new and creative ways; the browsers usually only react once a threat has been identified and reported.  </p><p id=p366>How to Set Up a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-12' style='color:red'>Phishing FilterWhile</span>are many different options, most phishing filters are activated in the same way: through a preference or options panel. We'll show you how to set up a filter in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-13' style='color:red'>Outlook</span>and Google Chrome. </p><p id=p407>How to Set Up the Filter in OutlookBy default, Outlook is set to No Automatic Filtering. (In 2007 versions or earlier, it is set to Low, catching only the most obvious <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-14' style='color:red'>spam/phishing</span>attacks). These emails are stripped of their URLs and/or HTML and placed in the Junk folder. </p><p id=p455>In the Junk Email Options panel (under Home>Delete>Junk>) you can switch it to Low or High, which will be more aggressive in the emails it flags. </p><p id=p481>The most extreme option is Safe Lists Only, which restricts email to those on your Safe Senders List or email subscriptions on your Safe Recipients List. If you use High or Restricted, it's a good idea to periodically check the folder for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-15' style='color:red'>legitimate</span>emails that slip through. (To move it back to your inbox, click the email and select Junk Email>Not Junk.) </p><p id=p543>You can further enhance the filter by adding a list of blocked senders, blocked domains, and blocked encodings (which disables URLs with characters from a different alphabet). </p><p id=p570>There are also a wide range of filter plugins for Outlook, such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-16' style='color:red'>Cloudmark SafetyBar, Disruptor OL,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-17' style='color:red'>SpamCatcher.</span></p><p id=p589>How to Set Up the Filter in Google ChromeUnder Advanced Settings or chrome://settings/, click the Privacy tab, and check to ensure malware and phishing protection is enabled by turning on "Protect you and your device from dangerous sites." This will connect it to a database of malicious websites that is regularly updated and alert you with a big red warning page, as shown above. </p><p id=p653>Under Privacy>Content Settings, it is recommended you set Flash to "ask first," as some phishing sites <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-18' style='color:red'>exploit</span>vulnerabilities in Flash to give your computer a virus. Also set automatic downloads and unsandboxed plugin access to "ask first." </p><p id=p690>You can enhance your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-19' style='color:red'>anti-phishing</span>security with plugins such as Windows Defender Browser Protection and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-20' style='color:red'>Password</span>Alert, which allows you to automatically reset your Google Password if you accidentally entered it in the wrong site. </p><p id=p725>Security Awareness </p><p id=p727><span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-21' style='color:red'>SecurityIQ PhishNotify+ DefenderAs</span>of the SecurityIQ platform, InfoSec Institute has created a special plugin for Outlook called <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-22' style='color:red'>PhishNotify+ Defender.</span>this email filter, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-88-23' style='color:red'>administrators</span>can remotely change the settings of any account, stripping messages of links or attachments amongst other safety features.
