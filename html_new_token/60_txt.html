Over half of the vulnerabilities addressed this month can be exploited remotely without <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-16' style='color:red'>authentication.</span></p><p id=p119>Oracle Hospitality Applications received the largest number of security fixes, at 48 – 11 of these may be remotely <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-17' style='color:red'>exploitable</span>without authentication. Oracle Fusion Middleware received 44 fixes (31 remotely exploitable without authentication), including one that addressed a critical <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-18' style='color:red'>vulnerability</span>(CVE-2017-10137 – CVSS score 10.0) in Oracle WebLogic Server. </p><p id=p168>Oracle also resolved large numbers of vulnerabilities in Oracle Java SE (32 – 28 remotely exploitable without authentication), Oracle PeopleSoft Products (30 – 20 remotely exploitable), Oracle MySQL (30 – 9 remotely exploitable), Oracle E-Business Suite (22 – 18 remotely exploitable), and Oracle Financial Services Applications (20 – 4 remotely exploitable). </p><p id=p219>The record-breaking number of 30 flaws addressed in PeopleSoft is worrying, especially since 20 of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-19' style='color:red'>bugs</span>can be exploited over the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-20' style='color:red'>network</span>without user credentials, ERPScan, a firm that specializes in security SAP and Oracle software, notes. </p><p id=p257>"Oracle PeopleSoft combines Supplier Relationship Management, Human Capital Management, Supply Chain Management, and other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-21' style='color:red'>applications.</span>The software has 6000+ enterprise customers and serves 20 million end users worldwide including more than 800 universities. Over 1000 PeopleSoft <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-22' style='color:red'>systems</span>are available on the Internet putting organizations at risk. According to the latest survey from Crowd Research partners, 89% of responders agreed that the number <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-23' style='color:red'>cyber-attacks</span>on ERP will significantly grow in the near future. SAP <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-24' style='color:red'>Attacks</span>may cost up to $50 million, PeopleSoft is definitely the same weight category," Alexander Polyakov, CTO at ERPScan, told SecurityWeek in an emailed statement. </p><p id=p355>82 of the vulnerabilities addressed in this quarter's CPU affect a scope of crucial business applications from Oracle, such as Oracle PeopleSoft, E-Business Suite, Siebel CRM, Oracle Financial Services, and Oracle Primavera Products Suite. Around 53% of these bugs can be exploited remotely without authentication. </p><p id=p400>One of the most important vulnerabilities in E-Business Suite (CVE-2017-10244) is an Information Disclosure issue  that could allow an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-25' style='color:red'>attacker</span>"to exfiltrate sensitive business <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-26' style='color:red'>data</span>without requiring a valid user account in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-27' style='color:red'>system,"</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-28' style='color:red'>Onapsis,</span>the company that discovered the issue, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-29' style='color:red'>reveals.</span>The flaw affects all supported Oracle E-Business Suite versions: 12.1.3, 12.2.3, 12.2.4, 12.2.5 and 12.2.6. </p><p id=p455>"This vulnerability is especially critical as an attacker would only need a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-30' style='color:red'>web</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-31' style='color:red'>browser</span>and network access to the EBS system to perform it. Any number of critical documents could be stored in the system including invoices, purchase orders, HR information and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-32' style='color:red'>design</span>documents to start.

It is crucial to update Oracle E-Business Suite with the last patch to fix all of these vulnerabilities and have the system up to date," Onapsis says. </p><p id=p622>The most critical issues resolved in the Oracle July 2017 CPU affect Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (CVE-2017-10137 – CVSS score 10.0), the OJVM component of Oracle Database Server (CVE-2017-10202 – CVSS score 9.9), the Oracle Communications BRM component of Oracle Communications Applications (CVE-2015-3253 – CVSS score 9.8), the MICROS PC Workstation 2015 component of Oracle Hospitality Applications (CVE-2017-5689 – CVSS score 9.8), and the MySQL Enterprise Monitor component of Oracle MySQL (CVE-2016-4436 – CVSS score 9.8). </p><p id=p702>Each quarter starting last year, Oracle has been <span class='token pointer' id='tok-60-37' style='color:red'>patching</span>an increasing number of vulnerabilities in its products.
