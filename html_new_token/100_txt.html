Some of the issues that reviewers say they've found: </p><p id=p672>Not working: Destroyed emails are still available (when accessing from your mobile device).

I have set a message to be destroyed in 1 hour and after over 12 hours it is still there for the recipient to read, though it says it has been destroyed on my end. Fix this and it will be 5 stars. </p><p id=p767>I've asked Dmail about these issues and will update the article if anybody gets back to me. </p><p id=p784>In the meantime, I'd suggest not expecting this app to reliably <span class='token pointer' id='tok-100-46' style='color:red'>flash-encrypt</span>anything in quick turn-around fashion, based on the reviews. </p><p id=p805>Also, take heed that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-100-47' style='color:red'>attachments</span>aren't encrypted at all, though Kuhn says that a self-destructing function may be added to a paid, future version of the service that Dmail expects to launch before winter. </p><p id=p839>Dmail plans to expand beyond Gmail to other platforms, including Google Apps. A Dmail iOS application will launch in August, and an Android release will follow.
