<p id=p0>While the moon was <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-0' style='color:red'>eclipsing</span>the sun, Google announced the launch of its new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-1' style='color:red'>operating</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-2' style='color:red'>mobile</span>called <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-3' style='color:red'>Oreo</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-4' style='color:red'>Android 8.0</span>an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-5' style='color:red'>Eclipse-themed</span>launch event in New York City. </p><p id=p30>Yes, the next version of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-6' style='color:red'>sugary</span>snack-themed <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-7' style='color:red'>Android</span>and the successor to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-8' style='color:red'>Android Nougat</span>now be known as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-9' style='color:red'>Android Oreo,</span>company revealed on Monday. </p><p id=p56>Google has maintained the tradition of naming its Android operating system by the names of alphabetically-ordered sugary delights beginning with Android <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-10' style='color:red'>Cupcake</span>and followed by Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat. </p><p id=p96>The good news is that the Android team has brought several significant features to your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-11' style='color:red'>smartphone</span>and tablet with the release of Android Oreo to make its mobile platform more secure, fast, power efficient and offer better <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-12' style='color:red'>multitasking.</span></p><p id=p134>The new updated mobile operating system, which has been available for the last few months in developer beta, will arrive on your Android devices by the end of this year. </p><p id=p164>Here's the list of features what I like in the new Android Oreo so far: </p><p id=p179>1. No More 'Install From <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-13' style='color:red'>Unknown Sources'</span></p><p id=p187>Not all applications installed from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-14' style='color:red'>third-party sources</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-15' style='color:red'>malicious,</span>but most of the apps installed from outside of the official Play Store could land you in trouble. </p><p id=p214>Prior to Android Oreo, third-party app installation requires users to enable just one setting by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-16' style='color:red'>turning</span>on "Install from unknown sources"—doesn't matter from where the user has downloaded an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-17' style='color:red'>APK file,</span>from a browser, Bluetooth, transferred from a computer via <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-18' style='color:red'>USB</span>or downloaded using another app. </p><p id=p261>Android 8.0 Oreo has completely changed the way this feature works, bringing a much smarter and safer system called "Install other apps," in which user has to manually permit <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-19' style='color:red'>3rd-party app installation</span>different sources. </p><p id=p296>2. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-20' style='color:red'>Autofill</span></p><p id=p300>It has already been advised to make use of complex and different passwords for online accounts and change <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-21' style='color:red'>them</span>frequently, but this makes it difficult for users to remember them at the same time. </p><p id=p334>To follow the best password policy in order to keep their accounts safe, most users rely on notepad/excel files to save their passwords insecurely, while some use password managers. </p><p id=p363>Some password manager apps for Android allow their users to Autofill saved <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-22' style='color:red'>information</span>into forms on other apps for which they require access to device's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-23' style='color:red'>accessibility permission</span>features. </p><p id=p392>However, with Android Oreo, password managers will no longer require <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-24' style='color:red'>Android's</span>accessibility features to fill in forms. </p><p id=p409>Android 8.0 Oreo brings a built-in secure <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-25' style='color:red'>AutoFill</span>API that allows users-chosen password manager to store different types of sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, phone numbers, and addresses—and works throughout the entire system. </p><p id=p445>3. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-26' style='color:red'>Picture-in-Picture</span></p><p id=p447>How many times does it happen to you when you want to watch a video on YouTube while chatting on WhatsApp? </p><p id=p468>It happens with me a lot of times, and I really get annoyed that if I'm watching a video, I can only watch that video and can't do anything on other apps <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-27' style='color:red'>simultaneously.</span>But this would not be a problem in Android 8.0 Oreo. </p><p id=p512>With Android Oreo, you can view a YouTube video while reading through a report in Word or be chatting on WhatsApp on your Android device—thanks to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-28' style='color:red'>Picture-in-Picture (PIP)</span></p><p id=p541><span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-29' style='color:red'>PIP</span>is one of the biggest features in the latest version of Android. If you open an app and start <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-30' style='color:red'>playing</span>a video, just press the home button, which will <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-31' style='color:red'>shrink</span>the video down to the bottom-right corner of your screen while the rest of the app disappears. </p><p id=p589>Now you can open any app and do other activities, while the video continues in the background. You can even move the video along the border of your screen, just like the Facebook Messenger icons, and tapping on the video will expand the video back into full-view. </p><p id=p635>4. </p><p id=p639>Android Oreo has been developed keeping 'Security' in mind, with Google cracking down on the fastest-growing problem of Android <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-32' style='color:red'>malware</span>with a new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-33' style='color:red'>anti-malware</span>tool called Google Play Protect. </p><p id=p668><span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-34' style='color:red'>"Play Protect</span>built into every device with Google Play, is always updating, and automatically takes action to keep your data and device safe, so you don't have to lift a finger," Dave <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-35' style='color:red'>Burke,</span>Vice President of engineering at Google said.Play Protect helps in detecting and removing harmful applications with more than 50 billion apps scanned every day. </p><p id=p726>5. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-36' style='color:red'>(Neighborhood Aware Networking</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-37' style='color:red'>NAN)Android Oreo</span>added support for a new connectivity feature called Wi-Fi Aware, also known as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-38' style='color:red'>Neighborhood Aware Networking (NAN),</span>allows apps and devices to automatically find, connect to, and share data with each other directly without any internet access point or cellular data. </p><p id=p778>Wi-Fi Aware is basically a combination of WiFi Direct and Nearby features to offer more reliable connection compared to Wi-Fi <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-39' style='color:red'>P2P,</span>allowing users to share data at high speed with a longer distance communication compared to Bluetooth. </p><p id=p815>Wi-Fi Aware API gives app developers a great opportunity to create awesome apps based on the communication between nearby devices. </p><p id=p835>6. Android Instant Apps </p><p id=p839>With Android 8.0 Oreo, you can now access a range of Instant Apps without downloading them. </p><p id=p855>First unveiled in May 2016, a new feature called Android Instant Apps is now available for more than 500 million devices globally, allowing users to launch certain apps within Google Play without having to download them. </p><p id=p891>Users can access Android Instant apps with a single click on a URL, just like a web page. </p><p id=p909>This feature could be more useful for those who are running out of storage space on their phone, wants to use an app for just once or intends to take a demo before installing the full version. </p><p id=p946>7. Battery-Saving Background Limits </p><p id=p950>Prior to Android 8.0 Oreo, developers can develop apps that could <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-40' style='color:red'>listen</span>for a broad range of system <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-41' style='color:red'>broadcasts</span>or changes on an Android device such as Wi-Fi turning on or a picture being taken, which negatively impact system performance and battery life. </p><p id=p993>Now, with Android Oreo, Google has blocked apps from reacting to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-42' style='color:red'>"implicit broadcasts"</span>carrying out certain tasks when they are running in the background in an effort to enhance the battery life of Android device. </p><p id=p1029>Besides this, Android Oreo will also limit some background services and location updates when an app is not in use. </p><p id=p1049>For example, if music app is playing music in the background, it will not be affected, but it will limit Instagram that doesn't need to be refreshing your feed from running in the background, allowing apps to use less power and wake up occasionally to start its services. </p><p id=p1097>8. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-43' style='color:red'>Smart</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-44' style='color:red'>Text</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-45' style='color:red'>Selection</span></p><p id=p1102>Android Oreo brings the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-46' style='color:red'>'Smart Text Selection'</span>which uses Google's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-47' style='color:red'>machine learning</span>detect when something like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-96-48' style='color:red'>physical addresses,</span>addresses, names or phone numbers is selected, then automatically suggests the relevant information on other apps. </p><p id=p1139>For example, if double tap text and select an address of a restaurant your friend sends you, Google's AI-based machine learning will figure out what you want and automatically launch directions with maps. </p><p id=p1172>The Assistant feature can perform the same, but it's always good to have multiple options to solve the same problem.
