That's not how warrants are supposed to work. Rather, they're supposed to be issued with a specific scope, with a specific target, and whatever government agency requested the warrant is supposed to investigate based on what the warrant turns up. </p><p id=p306>Now, the pigeons are coming home to roost. Or, rather, it's possible that the chickens may be able to fly the coop. </p><p id=p328>As the Star Tribune reports, the most recent Playpen case concerns that of Terry Lee Carlson, a 47-year-old from Minnesota, who was arrested following the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-8-22' style='color:red'>FBI's</span>so-called Operation Pacifier. </p><p id=p357>A federal magistrate judge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has recommended that evidence seized in Carlson's home – including 20 storage drives – be suppressed.
