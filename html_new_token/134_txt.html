<p id=p0>Visa and MasterCard are sending <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-0' style='color:red'>confidential</span>alerts to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-1' style='color:red'>financial</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-2' style='color:red'>institutions</span>across the United States this week, warning them about more than 200,000 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-3' style='color:red'>credit</span>cards that were stolen in the epic <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-4' style='color:red'>data</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-5' style='color:red'>breach</span>announced last week at big-three credit bureau <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-6' style='color:red'>Equifax.</span>At first glance, the private <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-7' style='color:red'>notices</span>obtained by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-8' style='color:red'>KrebsOnSecurity</span>appear to suggest that hackers initially breached Equifax starting in November 2016. But <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-9' style='color:red'>Equifax says</span>the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-10' style='color:red'>accounts</span>were all stolen at the same time — when hackers <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-11' style='color:red'>accessed</span>the company's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-12' style='color:red'>systems</span>in mid-May 2017. </p><p id=p79>Both Visa and MasterCard frequently send alerts to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-13' style='color:red'>card-issuing financial</span>institutions with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-14' style='color:red'>information</span>about specific credit and debit cards that may have been <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-15' style='color:red'>compromised</span>in a recent breach. But it is unusual for these alerts to state from which company the accounts were thought to have been pilfered. </p><p id=p126>In this case, however, Visa and MasterCard were <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-16' style='color:red'>unambiguous,</span>referring to Equifax specifically as the source of an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-17' style='color:red'>e-commerce</span>card breach. </p><p id=p147>In a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-18' style='color:red'>non-public</span>alert sent this week to sources at multiple banks, Visa said the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-19' style='color:red'>"window</span>of exposure" for the cards stolen in the Equifax breach was between Nov. 10, 2016 and July 6, 2017. A similar alert from MasterCard included the same date range. </p><p id=p192>"The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-20' style='color:red'>investigation</span>is ongoing and this information may be amended as new details arise," Visa said in its confidential alert, linking to the press release Equifax initially posted about the breach on Sept. 7, 2017. </p><p id=p227>The card giant said the data elements stolen included card account number, expiration date, and the cardholder's name. Fraudsters can use this information to conduct e-commerce fraud at online merchants. </p><p id=p256>It would be tempting to conclude from these alerts that the card breach at Equifax dates back to November 2016, and that perhaps the intruders then managed to install <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-21' style='color:red'>software</span>capable of capturing customer credit card data in real-time as it was entered on one of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-22' style='color:red'>Equifax's</span>Web sites. </p><p id=p305>Indeed, that was my initial hunch in deciding to report out this story. But according to a statement from Equifax, the hacker(s) <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-23' style='color:red'>downloaded</span>the data in one fell swoop in mid-May 2017. </p><p id=p337>"The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-24' style='color:red'>attacker</span>accessed a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-25' style='color:red'>storage</span>table that contained historical credit card <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-26' style='color:red'>transaction</span>related information," the company said. "The dates that you provided in your e-mail appear to be the transaction dates. We have found no evidence during our investigation to indicate the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-27' style='color:red'>presence</span>of card harvesting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-28' style='color:red'>malware,</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-29' style='color:red'>access</span>to the table before mid-May 2017." </p><p id=p392>Equifax did not respond to questions about how it was storing credit card data, or why only card data collected from customers after November 2016 was stolen. </p><p id=p419>In its initial breach disclosure on Sept. 7, Equifax said it discovered the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-30' style='color:red'>intrusion</span>on July 29, 2017. The company said the hackers broke in through a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-31' style='color:red'>vulnerability</span>in the software that powers some of its Web-facing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-32' style='color:red'>applications.</span></p><p id=p457>In an update to its breach disclosure published Wednesday evening, Equifax confirmed reports that the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-33' style='color:red'>application</span>flaw in question was a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-34' style='color:red'>weakness</span>disclosed in March 2017 in a popular open-source software package called <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-35' style='color:red'>Apache</span>Struts (CVE-2017-5638).  </p><p id=p492>"Equifax has been intensely investigating the scope of the intrusion with the assistance of a leading, independent cybersecurity firm to determine what information was accessed and who has been impacted," the company wrote. "We know that criminals <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-36' style='color:red'>exploited</span>a U.S. website application vulnerability. The vulnerability was Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638. We continue to work with law <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-37' style='color:red'>enforcement</span>as part of our criminal investigation, and have shared indicators of compromise with law enforcement." </p><p id=p563>The Apache flaw was first spotted around March 7, 2017, when security firms began warning that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-38' style='color:red'>attackers</span>were actively exploiting a "zero-day" vulnerability in Apache Struts. Zero-days refer to software or hardware flaws that hackers find and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-39' style='color:red'>figure</span>out how to use for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-40' style='color:red'>commercial</span>or personal gain before the vendor even knows about the bugs. </p><p id=p618>By March 8, Apache had released new versions of the software to mitigate the vulnerability. But by that time <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-41' style='color:red'>exploit</span>code that would allow anyone to take advantage of the flaw was already published online — making it a race between companies needing to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-42' style='color:red'>patch</span>their Web <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-43' style='color:red'>servers</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-44' style='color:red'>hackers</span>trying to exploit the hole before it was closed. </p><p id=p677>Screen shots apparently taken on March 10, 2017 and later posted to the vulnerability tracking site <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-45' style='color:red'>xss[dot]cx</span>indicate that the Apache Struts vulnerability was present at the time on annualcreditreport.com — the only web site <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-46' style='color:red'>mandated</span>by Congress where all Americans can go to obtain a free copy of their credit reports from each of the three major bureaus annually. </p><p id=p737>In another screen shot apparently made that same day and uploaded to xss[dot]cx, we can see evidence that the Apache Struts flaw also was present in Experian's Web properties. </p><p id=p766>Equifax has said the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-47' style='color:red'>unauthorized</span>access occurred from mid-May through July 2017, suggesting either that the company's Web applications were still <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-48' style='color:red'>unpatched</span>in mid-May or that the attackers broke in earlier but did not immediately abuse their access. </p><p id=p803>It remains unclear when exactly Equifax managed to fully <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-49' style='color:red'>eliminate</span>the Apache Struts flaw from their various Web server applications. But one thing we do know for sure: The hacker(s) got in before Equifax closed the hole, and their presence wasn't discovered until July 29, 2017. </p><p id=p849>Update, Sept. 15, 12:31 p.m. ET: Visa has updated their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-134-50' style='color:red'>advisory</span>about these 200,000+ credit cards stolen in the Equifax breach. Visa now says it believes the records also included the cardholder's Social Security number and address, suggesting that (ironically enough) the accounts were stolen from people who were signing up for credit monitoring services through Equifax. </p><p id=p906>Equifax also clarified the breach timeline to note that it patched the Apache Struts flaw in its Web applications only after taking the hacked system(s) offline on July 30, 2017. Which means Equifax left its systems unpatched for more than four months after a patch (and exploit code to attack the flaw) was publicly available.
