Particularly at fault here are AT&T, Comcast, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-33' style='color:red'>T-Mobile,</span>and Verizon -- all with a single star in the 'best practices' category. </p><p id=p283>This is not, however, universal in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-34' style='color:red'>telecoms.</span>"Credo <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-35' style='color:red'>Mobile</span>[5 stars] has repeatedly proven that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-36' style='color:red'>telecom companies</span>adopt policies that earn credit in every category year after year.

For example, of Google, EFF says, "This is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-44' style='color:red'>Google's</span>sixth year in Who Has Your Back, and it has adopted a number of industry best practices, including publishing a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-45' style='color:red'>transparency report,</span>a warrant for content, and publishing its guidelines for law enforcement requests.

On its own, this doesn't mean that Google does not have such a policy (it may or it may not), it simply has not publicly avowed the policy. </p><p id=p616>Apple is another tech giant that just falls short of five stars. Unlike Google, it does have a publicly stated policy of demanding a judicial review on all NSLs. Apple's published policy states, "If Apple receives a National Security Letter (NSL) from the U.S. government that contains an indefinite <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-50' style='color:red'>gag order,</span>will notify the government that it would like the court to review the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-51' style='color:red'>nondisclosure provision</span>the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-52' style='color:red'>NSL pursuant to USA FREEDOM</span></p><p id=p691>Apple is not, however, specifically <span class='token pointer' id='tok-16-53' style='color:red'>campaigning</span>for the </p><p id=p703>Two companies criticized by EFF are Amazon and WhatsApp, both receiving just 2 stars.
