<p id=p0>The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-0' style='color:red'>UK</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-1' style='color:red'>government</span>has announced its plans for a new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-2' style='color:red'>Data Protection Bill.</span>was foreshadowed in the Queen's Speech of 21 June when she announced, "A new law will ensure that the United Kingdom retains its world-class regime protecting personal data." </p><p id=p42>This law is, in effect, the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-3' style='color:red'>European General Data Protection Regulation</span>to withstand <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-4' style='color:red'>Brexit.</span>The UK will still be part of the European Union when <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-5' style='color:red'>GDPR</span>comes into effect in May 2018. However, the government is already under great pressure to transpose 40 years of European laws onto the British statute books in time for the actual severance. It makes sense, therefore, to prepare a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-6' style='color:red'>GDPR-compliant</span>UK law immediately. </p><p id=p112>The wording of the new Bill is not expected to become public until September. However, the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-7' style='color:red'>Digital,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-8' style='color:red'>Department for</span>Media & Sport yesterday published a 30 page Statement of Intent (PDF) in which The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-9' style='color:red'>Minister of State for Digital,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-10' style='color:red'>"Implementation</span>will be done in a way that as far as possible preserves the concepts of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-11' style='color:red'>Data Protection Act</span>ensure that the transition for all is as smooth as possible, while complying with the GDPR and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-12' style='color:red'>DPLED</span>in full." </p><p id=p199>It follows, then, that US <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-13' style='color:red'>companies</span>that operate in compliance with the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-14' style='color:red'>UK Data Protection Bill</span>(or should) be automatically in compliance with GDPR. The reverse is not necessarily true. For example, while the GDPR requires the use of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-15' style='color:red'>anonymized</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-16' style='color:red'>pseudonymised</span>(its own term) personal data, the new DP Bill will: "Create a new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-17' style='color:red'>offence</span>of intentionally or recklessly re-identifying individuals from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-18' style='color:red'>anonymised</span>or pseudonymised data. Offenders who knowingly handle or process such data will also be guilty of an offence. The maximum penalty would be an unlimited fine." </p><p id=p290>Since this is new, and we do not yet know the detail of the proposed Bill, it is impossible to tell whether there will be any attempt to make this a worldwide offense. It is difficult, however, to see how it could be enforced in foreign jurisdictions where the company or persons concerned have no direct presence within the UK. </p><p id=p350>Other new elements include a new offence of altering records with intent to prevent <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-19' style='color:red'>disclosure</span>following a subject access request (with an unlimited fine in England and Wales); while criminal justice agencies (read law enforcement) will have "A more prescriptive logging requirement applied to specific operations of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-20' style='color:red'>automated processing systems</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-21' style='color:red'>collection,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-22' style='color:red'>alteration,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-23' style='color:red'>consultation,</span>disclosure, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-24' style='color:red'>combination</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-25' style='color:red'>erasure</span>of data, so a full audit trail will be available." </p><p id=p418>Another feature that will undoubtedly change will be the ultimate court of appeal in case of dispute. For the GDPR it will be the European Court of Justice (as it will be in the UK until Brexit takes effect). "At Brexit (depending on its nature)," Dr Brian Bandey, a Doctor of Law specializing in international cyber laws, told SecurityWeek, "the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-26' style='color:red'>GDPR's</span>effectiveness as a law will terminate. I believe it likely that simultaneously with that event, the new Data Protection Bill will come into force. I expect the whole of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-27' style='color:red'>Data Protection Act 1998</span>be repealed. It is at that time that the Supreme Court will be the ultimate Court of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-28' style='color:red'>Appeal</span>with respect to this matter." </p><p id=p537>Whether the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-29' style='color:red'>UK's</span>Supreme Court will be as aggressive in upholding the constitution (the UK does not have a written constitution in the usual sense of the term) as has the European Court, remains to be seen. David Flint, a senior partner at MacRoberts LLP, does not see a problem. He believes that the overriding motivation behind the new Bill is to ensure smooth ongoing business trading between the UK and the EU. GDPR <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-30' style='color:red'>'adequacy'</span>thus becomes an essential element.Â  </p><p id=p617>"The fact that UK citizens cannot appeal to the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-31' style='color:red'>ECJ</span>is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-32' style='color:red'>arguably</span>a loss," he told SecurityWeek, "but in practice it is difficult to see how a UK court could or would not take cognizance of the decisions of the ECJ in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-33' style='color:red'>interpreting</span>the UK Act; were they to diverge in interpretation, again the adequacy finding would be in jeopardy." </p><p id=p677>What does seem likely is that not all the 'optional' elements of GDPR will be enacted within the new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-34' style='color:red'>DPB.</span>The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-35' style='color:red'>Open Rights Group</span>already issued a statement saying, "We are disappointed that UK Ministers are not taking up the option in EU law to allow consumer privacy groups to lodge independent data protection complaints as they can currently do under consumer rights laws." </p><p id=p742>However, says Flint, "The 2017 UK Data Protection Bill is designed to cover the limited number of instances within the GDPR in which Member States are able to make choices or derogations; issues such as the age of consent for children, for automatic profiling, law enforcement and research. We are told that the UK is adopting a UK solution to these questions." </p><p id=p804>It seems, then, that any divergences between the UK Data Protection Bill and the GDPR will largely be limited to UK relevance only. Where US companies are concerned, future <span class='token pointer' id='tok-18-36' style='color:red'>post-Brexit</span>trading with the UK will be subject to the same conditions and the same potential fines for non-compliance, as they will be for trading with the European Union under GDPR.
