The tools utilized can do this either by taking a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-3' style='color:red'>snapshot</span>of one of your physiological traits (such as capturing an image of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-4' style='color:red'>fingerprint,</span>an iris or your face) or behavioral traits (such as the way you sign your signature or the way in which you type on a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-5' style='color:red'>computer</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-6' style='color:red'>keyboard).</span></p><p id=p67>It is important to note that these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-7' style='color:red'>snapshots</span>are also technically referred to as </p><p id=p83>The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-8' style='color:red'>ProcessFirst,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-9' style='color:red'>Identification</span>individual must have an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-10' style='color:red'>enrollment template</span>by the appropriate biometric <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-11' style='color:red'>device.</span>To make the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-12' style='color:red'>template,</span>the unique features are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-13' style='color:red'>extracted</span>from the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-14' style='color:red'>raw image</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-15' style='color:red'>converted</span>into a </p><p id=p118>Let's take the example of fingerprint <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-16' style='color:red'>recognition.</span>After the raw image of the fingerprint is actually captured, it is then closely examined by the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-17' style='color:red'>system</span>to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-18' style='color:red'>extract</span>the unique features. This would include such items as the breaks, deltas and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-19' style='color:red'>bifurcations</span>that are found in the ridges, whorls and valleys of the fingerprint.

If, however, this individual's identity still cannot be confirmed by the fingerprint recognition system, then another identity mechanism must be utilized. </p><p id=p390>The Two Types of Accesses in BiometricsIn the world of biometrics, there are two types of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-29' style='color:red'>accesses</span>in which a biometric device, such as fingerprint recognition, would be used. These are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-30' style='color:red'>access</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-31' style='color:red'>physical</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-32' style='color:red'>logical access entry.</span>the former, one can actually do away completely with the traditional key in order to unlock a door. </p><p id=p447>For instance, in this scenario, the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-33' style='color:red'>fingerprint recognition device</span>be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-34' style='color:red'>wired</span>directly to an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-35' style='color:red'>electromagnetic</span>lock strike on the door. If the individual's identity is confirmed via the process as described in the last section, the lock strike will unlock and the door will open automatically by itself. An example of this is illustrated below: </p><p id=p503>The second type of access is reviewed in the next section. </p><p id=p514><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-36' style='color:red'>Logical Access EntryIn</span>world of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-37' style='color:red'>cybersecurity</span>today, one of the most sought-after prizes of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-38' style='color:red'>cyberattacker</span>is that of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-39' style='color:red'>password.</span>Once he or she has this in their possession, they can gain access to all sorts of banking and credit card account websites. As of late, there have been many problems with using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-40' style='color:red'>passwords</span>and businesses and corporations are mandating that all employees, even those in upper management, create long and complex passwords that are difficult to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-41' style='color:red'>crack.</span></p><p id=p594>Because many employees will probably not remember these passwords, they often write them down on a Post-It note and stick to their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-42' style='color:red'>workstation</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-43' style='color:red'>monitor.</span>This has been appropriately called the "Post-It Syndrome." As a result, password managers are now being used, but these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-44' style='color:red'>software</span>packages also have some security issues. Although they do store passwords quite <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-45' style='color:red'>securely,</span>the caveat here is that in order to access the password manager, another password must be created, and this cannot be stored in the password manager itself. It is the responsibility of the employee to keep this master password safe. </p><p id=p691>So the use of biometric technology is now being seen as an alternative to the password for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-46' style='color:red'>logical</span>access types of scenarios in order to gain access to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-47' style='color:red'>shared resources</span>the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-48' style='color:red'>server</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-49' style='color:red'>network</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-50' style='color:red'>drives,</span>and other kinds and types of sensitive <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-51' style='color:red'>information</span>that reside in the business or corporation. So in a literal sense, an individual's fingerprint becomes their password in this regard. Instead of having to enter their password each and every time in order to gain access to the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-52' style='color:red'>files</span>and resources that the employees need to do their everyday job functions, just one swipe of the finger or even a quick scan of the iris will gain them logical access entry. </p><p id=p806>The Biometric Devices Used in Logical Access Entry ApplicationsFor logical access entry <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-53' style='color:red'>applications,</span>there are two primary type of biometric modalities that are used: fingerprint recognition and iris recognition. </p><p id=p835>Both of these modalities can either can come as standalone <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-54' style='color:red'>devices</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-55' style='color:red'>embedded</span>into the computer or wireless device itself. In the case of the former, these devices are small enough that they can literally either sit on top of the server or to the side of it. They are connected via a simple <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-56' style='color:red'>USB</span>connection. </p><p id=p891>It is important to note at this point that the use of biometrics as a means of logical access entry is also referred to as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-57' style='color:red'>Single Sign-On</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-58' style='color:red'>"SSOs"</span>for short. </p><p id=p923>The glass that can be seen at the top of the device is actually the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-59' style='color:red'>sensor.</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-60' style='color:red'>optical</span>is where the employee can place their fingerprint in order to have it <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-61' style='color:red'>scanned</span>and to complete the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-62' style='color:red'>identification</span>process. </p><p id=p961>The employee will have to hold this device a few inches away from their eye. From there, the circular component (which is an actual camera) will take <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-63' style='color:red'>images</span>of the iris and convert them over to the raw images so that the unique features can be collected. The unique features that are captured from the iris are the mathematical vector-based orientations of the furrows, freckles and other spots contained within it. </p><p id=p1032>In terms of actually being embedded into a device, it is fingerprint recognition that is used the most. Probably the most popular example of this is the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-64' style='color:red'>Touch ID</span>which is already implemented into the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-65' style='color:red'>iPhone.</span></p><p id=p1069>The Use of Biometrics in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-66' style='color:red'>Authentication</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-67' style='color:red'>(2FA)As</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-68' style='color:red'>Two-Factor</span>have reviewed in this article, using biometrics (such as either fingerprint recognition and/or iris recognition) is being viewed as the next, complete replacement for the use of passwords, at least when it comes to logical <span class='token pointer' id='tok-28-69' style='color:red'>access-based</span>applications.
