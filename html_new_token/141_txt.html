I'm not aware of another method for opting out or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-23' style='color:red'>signing</span>up, but I've asked Equifax for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-24' style='color:red'>clarification</span>on that point. </p><p id=p464>Consumers who don't want Equifax sharing their phone number and email address with Experian need to opt-out by clicking a link in an email. </p><p id=p488>Fundamentally, I see no problem with people using these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-25' style='color:red'>credit monitoring services</span>long as they are free.

That said, Equifax's FAQ suggests this might not be the case, noting that if your Equifax credit report is frozen, the security freeze will stay in place for people who enroll in the new program. </p><p id=p799>I imagine this arrangement should help the credit bureaus steer more people away from freezing their and toward their respective <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-36' style='color:red'>"credit lock"</span>which the bureaus have marketed as just as good as a credit freeze but also easier to use. </p><p id=p840>All three big bureaus tout their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-37' style='color:red'>credit lock services</span>an easier and faster alternative to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-38' style='color:red'>freezes</span>— mainly because these alternatives aren't as disruptive to their bottom lines. According to a recent post <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-39' style='color:red'>by CreditKarma.com,</span>consumers can use these services to quickly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-40' style='color:red'>lock</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-141-41' style='color:red'>unlock</span>access to credit inquiries, although some bureaus can take up to 48 hours.
