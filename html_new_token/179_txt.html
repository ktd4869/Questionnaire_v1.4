Brazil, which used to be in second place, fell two places to fourth, even though the amount of spam originating there increased by 0.7% compared to the previous month.

In the run-up to Christmas, Nigerian letters try to appeal to the users' religious feelings. For example, we received a letter from an inconsolable widow who had just inherited a multi-million dollar fortune from her deceased husband. In the letter, the widow expressed her willingness to share a modest portion of her money with a pious Christian. </p><p id=p983>  </p><p id=p985>This year Christmas seems to have affected the content of messages from spammers of fake designer goods and those behind the various Nigerian letters.
