They capture passwords that you enter on one device or website, store them in an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-21' style='color:red'>encrypted</span>form in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-22' style='color:red'>cloud</span>and then automatically fill in your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-23' style='color:red'>credentials</span>the next time you need them, so you don't have to remember them. </p><p id=p275>Your stored credentials are tied to a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-24' style='color:red'>central identifying account</span>each service.

They are mostly without bells and whistles at the moment – they <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-32' style='color:red'>encrypt,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-33' style='color:red'>transmit,</span>and then store your passwords centrally in the cloud and allow you to lock down your password manager account with a master password and/or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-34' style='color:red'>biometric</span>security. Pretty standard. </p><p id=p533>Smart Lock doesn't generate passwords for you – though iCloud can – so, Google users, the burden is still on you to think up a strong password, and undoubtedly this means a lot of people won't. Smart Lock will just fill up with multiple copies of passw0rd1 instead of a collection of strong, rare passwords. </p><p id=p587>Where 3rd party managers loseOne area where both Google and Apple have a number of third-party password managers beat is storing credentials for smartphone apps – there are third-party password managers that do support storing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-35' style='color:red'>app</span>credentials, but not all of them do just yet. As of Apple iOS 11, iCloud Keychain supports app sign-ins with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-36' style='color:red'>AutoFill.</span></p><p id=p644>iOS 11 users can save credentials not just for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-37' style='color:red'>web-based</span>forms, but even for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-38' style='color:red'>stand-alone</span>apps. These credentials are saved to the iCloud Keychain, and when the user logs back into the app in the future, they'll be presented with the option to have AutoFill automatically enter their credentials and log in. </p><p id=p696>Similarly, Google notes that Smart Lock can fill in credentials for some apps, but not all. </p><p id=p712>Those of us who use third-party password managers have a few more steps to take if the app doesn't already support grabbing credentials from password managers (switch apps, log in to password manager, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-39' style='color:red'>copy/paste</span>the credentials). </p><p id=p748>It remains to be seen if Apple or Google will make pulling credentials from third-party password managers easier, or if they will leave that up to individual app developers to support as they do now. </p><p id=p783>How do I enable or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-40' style='color:red'>disable</span>these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-41' style='color:red'>password managers?If</span>using a recently updated Apple or Google smartphone, unless you've taken steps to disable your password manager it's likely already active and working for you. But if you want to make sure the service is enabled, or if you want to disable it, here's how: </p><p id=p838>Google's Password Vault: go to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-42' style='color:red'>passwords.google.com,</span>sign in and disable Google Smart Lock.Apple's iCloud Keychain: log in to your iCloud account on a Mac or iPhone, and check the iCloud options in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-101-43' style='color:red'>Settings</span>and select the "Keychain" option.As these services come with your phone they'll be an easy choice for many who may have bristled at the idea of using a password manager previously. And for those of us who want to see more people moving to password managers, no matter how imperfect, this is absolutely a good thing.
