While state-sponsored hackers thought to be responsible for this breach were likely interested in the data for more strategic than financial reasons (recruiting, discovering and/or thwarting spies), the OPM should not force breach victims to pay for true protection. </p><p id=p256>As I've noted in story after story, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-19' style='color:red'>identity protection services</span>those offered by CSID, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-20' style='color:red'>Experian</span>and others do little to block identity theft: The most you can hope for from these services is that they will notify you after crooks have opened a new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-21' style='color:red'>line of credit</span>your name.

For example, CSID offers the ability to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-24' style='color:red'>"monitor thousands</span>of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-25' style='color:red'>websites,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-26' style='color:red'>forums</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-27' style='color:red'>chat rooms,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-28' style='color:red'>networks,</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-29' style='color:red'>alerts</span>you if your personal information is being bought or sold <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-30' style='color:red'>online."</span>But in order to use this service, users are encouraged to provide bank account and credit card data, passport and medical ID numbers, as well as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-31' style='color:red'>telephone</span>numbers and driver's license information. </p><p id=p410>The only step that will reliably block identity thieves from accessing your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-32' style='color:red'>credit file</span>and therefore applying for new loans, credit cards and otherwise ruining your good name — is freezing your credit file with the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-33' style='color:red'>major credit bureaus.</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-34' style='color:red'>freeze</span>process — described in detail in the primer, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-35' style='color:red'>Freeze</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-36' style='color:red'>Security</span>can be done online or over the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-37' style='color:red'>phone.</span>Each <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-38' style='color:red'>bureau</span>will give the consumer a unique <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-39' style='color:red'>personal identification number (PIN)</span>the consumer will need to provide in the event that he needs to apply for new credit in the future. </p><p id=p513>But there's a catch: Depending on the state in which you reside, the freeze can cost $5 to $15 per credit bureau. Also, in some states consumers can be charged a fee to temporarily lift the freeze. </p><p id=p550>It is true that most states allow consumers who can show they have been or are likely to be a victim of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-40' style='color:red'>ID theft</span>obtain the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-41' style='color:red'>freezes</span>for free, but this generally requires the consumer to file a police report, obtain and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-42' style='color:red'>mail</span>a copy of that report along with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-43' style='color:red'>photocopied</span>identity documents, and submit an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-44' style='color:red'>affidavit</span>swearing that the victim believes his or her statement about identity theft to be true. </p><p id=p623>Unsurprisingly, many who seek the comprehensive protection offered by a freeze in the wake of a breach are more interested in securing the freeze than they are untangling a huge knot of red tape, and so they pay the freeze fees and get on with their lives. </p><p id=p668>The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-45' style='color:red'>OPM's</span>advisory on this breach includes the same boilerplate advice sent to countless victims in other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-46' style='color:red'>breaches,</span>including the admonition to monitor's one's financial statements carefully, to obtain a free copy of one's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-47' style='color:red'>annualcreditreport.com,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-48' style='color:red'>credit report from</span>to consider filing a free and/or fraud alert with the three major credit <span class='token pointer' id='tok-127-49' style='color:red'>bureaus.</span>Nowhere does the agency mention the availability or merits of establishing a security freeze. </p><p id=p735>If you were affected by the OPM breach, or if you're interested in learning more about what you can do to protect your identity, please read this story.
