In his admin role, he's been very helpful to customers: he's dealt with complaints, provided tips on staying anonymous on the dark web, and posted the names of Dream Market's official staff. </p><p id=p284>That's great for customers. Not so great when it comes to racking up <span class='token pointer' id='tok-149-11' style='color:red'>conspiracy</span>charges, though.

For one thing, they compared Vallerius' writing style on his public Instagram and Twitter accounts to OxyMonster's forum posts on Dream Market and found many similarities, such as use of the word "cheers," double exclamation marks, frequent use of quotation marks, and intermittent French posts. </p><p id=p416><span class='token pointer' id='tok-149-14' style='color:red'>DEEP LEARNING FOR DEEPER CYBERSECURITY</span>Watch Video The other thing that connected OxyMonster with Vallerius was the use of his real <span class='token pointer' id='tok-149-15' style='color:red'>email address to</span>payments. The agents tracked incoming and outgoing transactions from a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-149-16' style='color:red'>bitcoin</span>address associated with sales on the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-149-17' style='color:red'>site</span>and discovered that most of them went to Vallerius on Localbitcoins.com. </p><p id=p471>But it was the beard contest that really tripped him up in the end. </p><p id=p485>On 31 August 2017, Vallerius left France to travel to the US for the first time ever. He came over to attend the finals of the World Beard and Moustache Championships in Austin, Texas. </p><p id=p519>But upon his arrival at Atlanta International Airport, he was detained for a border search.

He's expected to be transferred soon to Miami to face a new conspiracy indictment that carries up to life in prison. </p><p id=p629>This is the point where we typically mention that maximum sentences are rarely handed out. But it's been two years since Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht was given life without parole for his own journeys down the dark web wormhole. </p><p id=p669>Granted, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-149-22' style='color:red'>Ulbricht's</span>drug dealing and other crimes were one thing. If it was only drugs, maybe he wouldn't have received such a long sentence. But he also had six separate murder-for-hire incidents leveled against him. None wound up on the final charge-sheet, but the added weight of violence was thought to perhaps have had an impact on the decision to levy a heavy punishment. </p><p id=p733>The judge most certainly wanted to make an example out of him. At the time of Ulbricht's sentencing, Judge Katherine Forrest said just that: </p><p id=p757>For those considering stepping into your shoes… they need to understand very clearly and without equivocation that if you break the law this way there will be very, very severe consequences. </p><p id=p788>In reality, shutting down Silk Road, locking away Ulbricht and throwing away the key hasn't put a dent in the dark web trade of illicit goods. In fact, according to a new study, dark web marketplaces are thriving. </p><p id=p826>Media coverage of Ulbricht has actually amounted to free advertising for the business model he set up. When researcher Isak Ladegaard analyzed sales data from Agora – another large dark web market similar to Silk Road – he found that US sales doubled over the 10-month period following Ulbricht's sentencing. </p><p id=p875>Ladegaard says the media coverage surrounding Ulbricht's case likely made more people aware of the existence of dark web markets. They weren't discouraged; they were intrigued: </p><p id=p901>The timing suggests that people weren't discouraged from buying and selling drugs. The data suggests that trade increased. And one likely explanation is that all the media coverage only made people more aware of the existence of the Silk Road and similar markets. </p><p id=p944>Perhaps after this arrest the World Beard and Moustache Championships should brace itself for a surge in interest too.
