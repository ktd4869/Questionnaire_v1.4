<p id=p0>For the second time in the past nine months, Google has <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-0' style='color:red'>inadvertently</span>but <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-1' style='color:red'>nonetheless</span>correctly helped to identify the source of a large credit card <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-2' style='color:red'>breach</span>— by assigning a "This site may be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-3' style='color:red'>hacked"</span>warning beneath the search results for the Web site of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-4' style='color:red'>victimized</span>merchant. </p><p id=p48>A little over a month ago, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-5' style='color:red'>KrebsOnSecurity</span>was contacted by multiple financial institutions whose <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-6' style='color:red'>anti-fraud</span>teams were trying to trace the source of a great deal of fraud on cards that were all used at a handful of high-end restaurants around the country. </p><p id=p91>Two of those fraud teams shared a list of restaurants that all affected cardholders had visited recently. A bit of searching online showed that nearly all of those establishments were run by Select Restaurants Inc., a Cleveland, Ohio company that owns a number of well-known eateries nationwide, including Boston's Top of the Hub; Parker's Lighthouse in Long Beach, Calif.; the Rusty Scupper in Baltimore, Md.; Parkers Blue Ash Tavern in Cincinnati, Ohio; Parkers' Restaurant & Bar in Downers Grove, Illinois; Winberie's Restaurant & Bar with locations in Oak Park, Illinois and Princeton and Summit, New Jersey; and Black Powder Tavern in Valley Forge, PA. </p><p id=p191>Google's search listing for Select Restaurants, which indicates Google thinks this site may be hacked. </p><p id=p206>Knowing very little about this company at the time, I ran a Google search for it and noticed that Google believes the site may <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-7' style='color:red'>be hacked</span>(it still carries this message). This generally means some portion of the site was compromised by scammers who are trying to abuse the site's search engine rankings to beef up the rankings for "spammy" sites — such as those peddling <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-8' style='color:red'>counterfeit</span>prescription drugs and designer handbags. </p><p id=p276>The "This site may be hacked" advisory is not quite as dire as Google's "This site may harm your computer" warning — the latter usually means the site is actively trying to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-9' style='color:red'>foist</span>malware on the visitor's computer. But in my experience it's never a good sign when a business that accepts credit cards has one of these warnings attached to its search engine results. </p><p id=p340>Case in point: I experienced this exact scenario last summer as I was reporting out the details on the breach at CiCi's Pizza chain. In researching that story, all signs were pointing to a point-of-sale (POS) terminal provider called Datapoint POS. Just like it did with Select Restaurants's site, Google reported that Datapoint's site appeared to be hacked. </p><p id=p398>Google believed Datapoint's Web site <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-10' style='color:red'>was hacked.</span></p><p id=p404>Select Restaurants did not return messages seeking comment. But as with the breach at Cici's Pizza chains, the breach involving Select Restaurant locations mentioned above appears to have been the result of an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-11' style='color:red'>intrusion</span>at the company's POS vendor — Geneva, Ill. based 24×7 Hospitality Technology. 24×7 handles credit and debit card transactions for thousands of hotels and restaurants. </p><p id=p463>On Feb. 14, 24×7 Hospitality sent a letter to customers warning that its systems recently were hacked by a "sophisticated network intrusion through a remote access application." Translation: Someone guessed or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-12' style='color:red'>phished</span>the password that we use to remotely administer point-of-sale systems at its customer locations. 24×7 said the attackers subsequently executed the PoSeidon malware variant, which is designed to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-13' style='color:red'>siphon</span>card data when cashiers swipe credit cards at an infected cash register (for more on PoSeidon, check out POS Providers Feel Brunt of PoSeidon Malware). </p><p id=p549>KrebsOnSecurity obtained a copy of the letter (PDF) that 24×7 Hospitality CEO Todd Baker, Jr. sent to Select Restaurants. That <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-14' style='color:red'>missive</span>said even though the intruders apparently had access to all of 24×7 customers' payment systems, not all of those systems were logged into by the hackers. Alas, this was probably little consolation for Select Restaurants, because the letter then goes on to say that the breach involves all of the restaurants listed on Select's Web site, and that the breach appears to have extended from late October 2016 to mid-January 2017. </p><p id=p638>ANALYSIS From my perspective, organized crime gangs have so completely overrun the hospitality and restaurant point-of-sale systems here in the United States that I just assume my card may very well be compromised whenever I use it at a restaurant or hotel bar/eatery. I've received no fewer than three new credit cards over the past year, and I'd wager that in at least one of those cases I happened to have used the card at multiple merchants whose POS systems were hacked at the same time. </p><p id=p724>But no matter how many times I see it, it's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-15' style='color:red'>fascinating</span>to watch this slow motion train wreck play out. Given how much risk and responsibility for protecting against these types of hacking incidents is spread so thinly across the entire industry, it's little wonder that organized crime gangs have been picking off POS providers for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-16' style='color:red'>Tier</span>3 and Tier 4 merchants with PoSeidon en masse in recent years. </p><p id=p793>I believe one big reason we keep seeing the restaurant and hospitality industry being taken to the cleaners by credit card thieves is that in virtually all of these incidents, the retailer or restaurant has no direct relationships to the banks which have issued the cards that will be run through their hacked POS systems. Rather, these small Tier 3 and Tier 4 merchants are usually buying merchant services off of a local systems integrator who often is in turn reselling access to a third-party payment processing company. </p><p id=p881>As a result, very often when these small chains or solitary restaurants get hit with PoSeidon, there is no record of a breach that is simple to follow from the breached merchant back to the bank which issued the cards used at those compromised merchants. It is only by numerous financial institutions experiencing fraud from the same restaurants and then comparing notes about possible POS vendors in common among these restaurants that banks and credit unions start to gain a clue about what's happening and who exactly has been hacked. </p><p id=p971>But this takes a great deal of time, effort and trust. Meanwhile, the crooks are laughing all the way to the bank. Another reason I find all this fascinating is that the two main underground cybercrime shops that appear to be principally responsible for offloading cards stolen in these Tier 3 and Tier 4 merchant breaches involving PoSeidon — stores like Rescator and Briansdump — both abuse my likeness in their advertisements and on their home pages. Here's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-140-17' style='color:red'>Briansdump:</span></p><p id=p1049>An advertisement for the carding shop "briansdump[dot]ru" promotes "dumps from the legendary Brian Krebs." Needless to say, this is not an endorsed site. </p><p id=p1072>Finally, if your credit card is compromised, try not to lose sleep over it: The chances of your finding out how that card was compromised are extremely low. This story seeks to explain why.
