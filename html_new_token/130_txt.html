<p id=p0>Visa this week <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-0' style='color:red'>delayed</span>by three years a deadline for fuel station owners to install <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-1' style='color:red'>payment terminals</span>the pump that are capable of handling more secure <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-2' style='color:red'>chip-based</span>cards. Experts say the new deadline — extended from 2017 — comes amid a huge spike in fuel pump <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-3' style='color:red'>skimming,</span>and means <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-4' style='color:red'>fraudsters</span>will have another three years to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-5' style='color:red'>fleece</span>banks and their customers by installing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-6' style='color:red'>card-skimming</span>devices at the pump. </p><p id=p68>Until this week, fuel station owners in the United States had until October 1, 2017 to install <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-7' style='color:red'>chip-capable</span>readers at their pumps. Under previous Visa rules, station owners that didn't have <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-8' style='color:red'>chip-ready</span>readers in place by then would have been on the hook to absorb 100 percent of the costs of fraud associated with transactions in which the customer presented a chip-based <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-9' style='color:red'>card</span>yet was not asked or able to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-10' style='color:red'>dip the chip</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-11' style='color:red'>card-issuing</span>banks eat most of the fraud costs from fuel skimming). The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-12' style='color:red'>chip</span>card technology standard, also known as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-13' style='color:red'>EMV</span>(short for Europay, MasterCard and Visa) makes credit and debit cards far more expensive and difficult for thieves to clone. </p><p id=p181>This week, however, Visa said fuel station owners would have until October 1, 2020 to meet the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-14' style='color:red'>liability</span>shift deadline. </p><p id=p201>A <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-15' style='color:red'>Bluetooth-based</span>pump <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-16' style='color:red'>skimmer</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-17' style='color:red'>card</span>inside of a Food N Things pump in Arizona in April 2016. </p><p id=p219>"The fuel <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-18' style='color:red'>segment</span>has its own unique challenges, which we recognized when we first set the chip activation date for automated fuel <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-19' style='color:red'>dispensers/pumps (AFDs)</span>years after regular in-store locations," Visa said in a statement explaining its decision. "We knew that the AFD segment would need more time to upgrade to chip because of the complicated infrastructure and specialized technology required for fuel pumps. For <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-20' style='color:red'>instance,</span>in some cases, older pumps may need to be replaced before adding <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-21' style='color:red'>chip readers,</span>specialized vendors and breaking into concrete. Furthermore, five years after announcing our liability shift, there are still issues with a sufficient supply of regulatory-compliant EMV <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-22' style='color:red'>hardware</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-23' style='color:red'>software</span>to enable most <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-24' style='color:red'>upgrades</span>by 2017." </p><p id=p334>Visa said fuel pump skimming accounts for just 1.3 percent of total U.S. payment card fraud. </p><p id=p350>"During this interim period, Visa will monitor AFD fraud trends closely and work with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-25' style='color:red'>merchants,</span>acquirers and issuers to help <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-26' style='color:red'>mitigate</span>any potential counterfeit fraud exposure at <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-27' style='color:red'>AFDs,"</span>Visa said. </p><p id=p380>Avivah Litan, a fraud analyst with Gartner Inc., said the deadline shift wasn't unexpected given how many U.S. fuel stations are behind on costly updates, noting that in some cases it can cost more than $10,000 per pump to accommodate chip card readers. The National Association of Convenience Stores estimates that station operators will spend approximately $30,000 per store to accommodate chip readers, and that the total cost to the fuel industry could exceed $4 billion. </p><p id=p456>"Some of them you can just replace the payment module inside the pump, but the older pumps will need to be completely removed and replaced," Litan said. "Gas stations and their unattended pumps have always been an easy target for thieves. The fraud usually <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-28' style='color:red'>migrates</span>to the point of least resistance, and we're seeing now the fraudsters really moving to targeting unattended stations that haven't been upgraded." </p><p id=p523>The delay comes as some states — particularly in the southern United States — are grappling with major increases in fuel station <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-29' style='color:red'>skimming attacks.</span>September, KrebsOnSecurity published a detailed look at nine months' worth of fuel pump skimming incident reports filed by police and regulators in Arizona, which said it saw more fuel station skimming attacks in the month of August 2016 than in all of 2015 combined. </p><p id=p592>That report about Arizona's skimmer scourge found that thieves tend to target pumps that are furthest from the pump station and closest to the street. They also favored stations that did not employ basic security measures such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-30' style='color:red'>tamper-evident</span>security tape and security cameras. </p><p id=p636>Crooks involved in fuel pump skimming generally are tied to organized crime gangs, as evidenced by this Nov. 2015 investigation into fuel theft gangs operating in Southern California . The thieves most often use stolen master keys or bribery to gain access to the pumps. Once inside the pumps, the thieves hook up their skimmer to the pump's card reader and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-31' style='color:red'>PIN</span>pad. The devices also are connected to the pump's electric power — so they don't need batteries and can operate indefinitely. Increasingly, these thieves are installing Bluetooth-based skimmers that can transmit stolen data <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-32' style='color:red'>wirelessly,</span>allowing thieves to avoid taking the risky step of retrieving their skimmer gear. </p><p id=p743>Some pump skimming devices are capable of stealing debit card PINs as well, so it's good idea to avoid paying with a debit card at the pump. Armed with your PIN and debit card data, thieves can clone the card and pull money out of your account at an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-33' style='color:red'>ATM.</span>Having your checking account <span class='token pointer' id='tok-130-34' style='color:red'>emptied</span>of cash while your bank sorts out the situation can be a huge hassle and create secondary problems (bounced checks, for instance). </p><p id=p820>"That's exactly the sort of advice fuel station owners don't want given to consumers," Litan said. "For filling stations, credit is their least favorite form of payment because it's the most expensive for them, which is why some stations offer lower prices for debit card transactions. But consumers should never use a debit card at a gas station." </p><p id=p878>Want to learn more about skimming devices? Check out my series, All About Skimmers.
