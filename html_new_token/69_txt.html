With its tool, we can automatically identify memory management and threading bugs, by eliminating hours of provoking bug-hunting and make programs more stable. We can also perform detailed profiling to help speed up program's processes and use Valgrind to build new tools.

However, Kali Linux provides us with some great and well known reverse engineering tools to perform such activities. Moreover, there are many other reverse engineering tools as well, but these tools are already built-in and come out of the box with Kali Linux. </p><p id=p1102>     </p>
