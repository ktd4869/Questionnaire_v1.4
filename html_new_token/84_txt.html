Today, we'll take an insider's look at an Apple <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-9' style='color:red'>iCloud phishing</span>that appears to work quite closely with organized crime rings — within the United States and beyond  — to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-10' style='color:red'>remotely</span>unlock and erase stolen <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-11' style='color:red'>Apple</span>devices. </p><p id=p73>Victims of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-12' style='color:red'>iPhone</span>theft can use the Find My iPhone feature to remotely locate, lock or erase their iPhone — just by visiting <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-13' style='color:red'>Apple's</span>site and entering their iCloud username and password. Likewise, an iPhone thief can use those iCloud credentials to remotely unlock the victim's stolen iPhone, wipe the device, and resell it. As a result, iPhone thieves often subcontract the theft of those credentials to third-party iCloud phishing services. This story is about one of those services. </p><p id=p150>The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-14' style='color:red'>account</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-15' style='color:red'>iCloud</span>text that John's friend received months after losing a family iPhone. </p><p id=p165>Recently, I heard from a security professional whose close friend received a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-16' style='color:red'>targeted</span>attempt to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-17' style='color:red'>phish</span>his Apple iCloud credentials. The phishing attack came several months after the friend's child lost his phone at a public park in Virginia. The phish arrived via text message and claimed to have been sent from Apple. It said the device tied to his son's phone number had been found, and that its precise location could be seen for the next 24 hours by clicking a link <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-18' style='color:red'>embedded</span>in the text message. </p><p id=p252>That security professional source — referred to as "John" for simplicity's sake — declined to be named or credited in this story because some of the actions he took to gain the knowledge presented here may run afoul of U.S. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-19' style='color:red'>computer</span>fraud and abuse laws. </p><p id=p295>John said his friend clicked on the link in the text message he received about his son's missing phone and was presented with a fake iCloud <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-20' style='color:red'>login</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-21' style='color:red'>page: appleid-applemx[dot]us.</span>A lookup on that domain indicates it is hosted on a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-22' style='color:red'>server</span>in Russia that is or was shared by at least 140 other domains — mostly other apparent iCloud phishing sites — such as accounticloud[dot]site; apple-appleid[dot]store; apple-devicefound[dot]org; and so on (a full list of the domains at that server is available here). </p><p id=p376>While the phishing server may be hosted in Russia, its core users appear to be in a completely different part of the world. Examining the server more closely, John noticed that it was (mis)configured in a way that leaked <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-23' style='color:red'>data</span>about various Internet addresses that were seen recently accessing the server, as well as the names of specific directories on the server that were being accessed. </p><p id=p442>After monitoring that logging information for some time, my source discovered there were five Internet addresses that communicated with the server multiple times a day, and that those address corresponded to devices located in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico. </p><p id=p481>He also found a file openly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-24' style='color:red'>accessible</span>on the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-25' style='color:red'>Russian server</span>indicated that an application running on the server was constantly sending requests to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-26' style='color:red'>imei24.com</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-27' style='color:red'>imeidata.net</span>— services that allow anyone to look up information about a mobile device by entering its unique <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-28' style='color:red'>Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.

The resulting page, pictured below, is a login page for an application called <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-32' style='color:red'>"iServer."</span>The login page displays a custom version of Apple's trademarked logo as part of a pirate's skull and crossbones motif, set against a background of bleeding orange flames. </p><p id=p644>The login page for an Apple iCloud credential phishing operation apparently used to unlock and remotely wipe stolen iPhones. </p><p id=p663>John told me that in addition to serving up that login page, the server also returned the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-33' style='color:red'>HTML</span>contents of the "index.php" he originally requested from the server. When he saved the contents of index.php to his computer and viewed it as a text file, he noticed it <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-34' style='color:red'>inexplicably</span>included a list of some 137 user names, email addresses and expiration dates for various users who'd apparently paid a monthly fee to access the iCloud phishing service. </p><p id=p740>"These appear to be 'resellers' or people that have access to the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-35' style='color:red'>crimeware server,"</span>source said of the user information listed in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-36' style='color:red'>server's</span>"index.php" file. </p><p id=p767>John told KrebsOnSecurity that with very little effort he was able to guess the password of at least two other users listed in that file. After John logged into the iCloud phishing service with those credentials, the service informed him that the account he was using was expired. John was then <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-37' style='color:red'>prompted</span>to pay for at least one more month subscription access to the server to continue. </p><p id=p832>Playing along, John said he clicked the "OK" button <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-38' style='color:red'>indicating</span>he wished to renew his subscription, and was taken to a shopping cart hosted on the domain hostingyaa[dot]com. That payment form in turn was accepting PayPal payments for an account tied to an entity called HostingYaa LLC; viewing the HTML source on that payment page revealed the PayPal account was tied to the email address "admin@hostingyaa[dot]com." </p><p id=p898>According to the file coughed up by the Russian server, the first username in that user list — demoniox12 — is tied to an email address admin@lanzadorx.net and to a zero-dollar subscription to the phishing service. This strongly indicates the user in question is an administrator of this phishing service. </p><p id=p948>A review of Lanzadorx[dot]net indicates that it is a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-39' style='color:red'>phishing-as-a-service</span>offering that advertises the ability to launch targeted phishing attacks at a variety of free online services, including <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-40' style='color:red'>accounts</span>at Apple, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-41' style='color:red'>Hotmail,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-42' style='color:red'>Gmail</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-43' style='color:red'>Yahoo,</span>among others. </p><p id=p985>A reverse <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-44' style='color:red'>WHOIS lookup</span>from Domaintools.com shows that the admin@lanzadorx.net email is linked to the registration data for exactly two domains — <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-45' style='color:red'>hostingyaa[dot]info</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-46' style='color:red'>lanzadorx[dot]net</span>[full disclosure: Domaintools is currently one of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-47' style='color:red'>several</span>advertisers on KrebsOnSecurity]. </p><p id=p1022><span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-48' style='color:red'>Hostingyaa[dot]info</span>is registered to a Dario Dorrego, one of the other zero-dollar accounts included near the top of the list of users that are authorized to access the iCloud phishing service. The site says Dorrego's account corresponds to the email address dario@hostingyaa[dot]com. That name Dario Dorrego also appears in the site registration records for 31 other Web site domains, all of which are listed here. </p><p id=p1087>John said he was able to guess the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-49' style='color:red'>passwords</span>for at least six other accounts on the iCloud phishing service, including one particularly interesting user and possible reseller of the service who picked the username <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-50' style='color:red'>"Jonatan." Below</span>is a look at the home screen for Jonatan's account on this iCloud phishing service. We can see the system indicates Jonatan was able to obtain at least 65 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-84-51' style='color:red'>"hacked IDs"</span>this service, and that he pays USD $80 per month for access to it.
