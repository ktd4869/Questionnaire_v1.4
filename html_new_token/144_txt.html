It was then that the luxury Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group run by White Lodging Services Corporation became the victim of a cyber <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-18' style='color:red'>attack</span>that breached the POS, and resulted in the possible theft of payment <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-19' style='color:red'>card</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-20' style='color:red'>data. The</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-21' style='color:red'>company</span>did not specify how many <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-22' style='color:red'>cards</span>were affected, but stated that it was a "limited number." </p><p id=p174>"Mandarin Oriental can confirm that the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-23' style='color:red'>credit</span>card <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-24' style='color:red'>systems</span>in an isolated number of our hotels in the U.S. and Europe have been accessed without <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-25' style='color:red'>authorization</span>and in violation of both <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-26' style='color:red'>civil</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-27' style='color:red'>criminal</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-28' style='color:red'>law,"</span>the company wrote in a press release announcing the breach.

Less than a month later, the group announced another <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-34' style='color:red'>suspected</span>hacking, this time of its restaurants and lounges. The company released the names of 10 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-35' style='color:red'>properties</span>that had been affected from July 3, 2014 through Feb. 6, 2015. Once again, the culprit was POS malware. </p><p id=p312>Since then, there has been no news of subsequent attacks on any White Lodging properties. However, the worst was still ahead for the rest of the hospitality industry. </p><p id=p340>A sequence of cyber attacks </p><p id=p345><span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-36' style='color:red'>Hilton:</span>In September 2015, Brian Krebs reported that several sources in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-37' style='color:red'>financial</span>industry had traced multiple cases of credit card fraud back to Hilton Hotel properties. At the time, there was no <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-38' style='color:red'>official</span>announcement from Hilton that confirmed this <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-39' style='color:red'>information.</span>This changed in November when the company wrote in a press release that its POS systems had, in fact, been breached and as a result, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-40' style='color:red'>cardholder</span>names and payment <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-41' style='color:red'>information were</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-42' style='color:red'>stolen.</span>Hilton noted in the release that the breach had affected <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-43' style='color:red'>customers</span>within a 17-week period, from Nov. 18 to Dec. 5, 2014 or April 21 to July 27, 2015. The company recommended cautious <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-44' style='color:red'>monitoring</span>of credit and payment card activity going forward for anyone that may have visited any of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-45' style='color:red'>Hilton's</span>properties within these time frames.  </p><p id=p471>Trump Hotel Collection: In between the time that the Hilton breach has first been suspected and confirmed, the Trump Hotel Collection confirmed suspicions of its own regarding a possible breach of its POS system. The company announced in early October that it had been <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-46' style='color:red'>actively</span>affected by malware for nearly a year, and that any customers who paid with credit or debit cards between the dates of May 19, 2014 and June 2, 2015, may have had payment information stolen. All of the following <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-47' style='color:red'>locations</span>were affected: Trump SoHo New York, Trump <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-48' style='color:red'>National</span>Doral, Trump <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-49' style='color:red'>International</span>New York, Trump International Chicago, Trump International Waikiki, Trump International Hotel & Tower Las Vegas and Trump International Toronto.SoHo New York, Trump National Doral, Trump International New York, Trump International Chicago, Trump International Waikiki, Trump International Hotel & Tower Las Vegas and Trump International Toronto. </p><p id=p609>Starwood: Shortly before Hilton confirmed its suspected breach in November, Starwood announced that 54 of its properties including Sheraton, Westin and W locations, had been preyed upon by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-50' style='color:red'>cyber attackers,</span>in the possible <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-51' style='color:red'>exposure</span>of debit and credit card information of its customers. Once again, the culprit was POS malware, and once again. The bug mainly affected restaurants, bars and gift shops.  </p><p id=p672>Hyatt Hotels: Two days before Christmas, Hyatt announced that it too had become the victim of a cyber attack targeting its payment systems, and that it was launching an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-52' style='color:red'>investigation</span>into the incident. As more details emerged, Trend <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-53' style='color:red'>Micro</span>reported that 250 Hyatt properties in more than 50 countries were affected by the breach. Other than the large-scale nature of the breach, the cyber attack fit the profile of all the hotel breaches that preceded it. The cyber threat mainly impacted restaurant POS systems, it is believe to have compromised customers' debit and credit card information and the malware was present in the system for a prolonged period – Aug.13 to Dec .8, 2015.  </p><p id=p785><span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-54' style='color:red'>What can be done going</span></p><p id=p791>Needless to say, this string of incidents are all clearly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-55' style='color:red'>connected,</span>not in the sense that they have been perpetrated by the same hacker necessarily, but in that they highlight a popular threat vector at the moment. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-56' style='color:red'>Going forward, there are several</span>steps that hotels can take to improve threat protection. </p><p id=p843>Firstly, any hotel chain that has not started using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-57' style='color:red'>EMV-enabled</span>card readers across its properties should do so immediately. The main benefit of EMV <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-58' style='color:red'>chip-card</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-59' style='color:red'>technology</span>is in its unique authentication measures. Unlike <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-60' style='color:red'>magnetic stripes,</span>share reusable, easily compromised payment data with each swipe,  EMV chips create a one-time <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-61' style='color:red'>transaction</span>code that if stolen, will essentially be worthless to a hacker. As of October 2015, merchants – including hotels – will be held accountable for losses associated with POS <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-62' style='color:red'>malware-related</span>card theft should they not use EMV-enabled card readers.  </p><p id=p933>More importantly, hotel management must stay up to date on cyber threats that are currently in circulation, especially targeted threats that single out the hospitality industry. For example, Trend Micro discovered a unique strain of malware called <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-63' style='color:red'>MalumPOS</span>in June 2015. The bug specifically targets data <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-64' style='color:red'>on POS</span>systems running on Oracle <span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-65' style='color:red'>MICROS,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-144-66' style='color:red'>software</span>that is used by merchants in multiple industries, but especially in hospitality. It is integral that hotels take findings such as these seriously, and not fall into the mindset of "this will never happen to us". From here, management must take every effort imaginable to protect sensitive customer information, and this includes leveraging threat protection software. As recent events have revealed, hotel breaches do happen, and a lot is at stake.
