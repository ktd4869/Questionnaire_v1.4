Similarly, your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-7' style='color:red'>privacy settings</span>have changed significantly since the last time you checked them, meaning that you're now over-sharing via your updates and posts online. </p><p id=p73>This could lead to various unintended <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-8' style='color:red'>consequences.</span>For example, a prospective employer may cut you from a shortlist of candidates because they don't like what they see on your <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-9' style='color:red'>Facebook page.</span>an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-10' style='color:red'>enterprising burglar</span>see from a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-11' style='color:red'>Twitter post</span>you're not at home and raid your property. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-12' style='color:red'>Hackers</span>might even <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-13' style='color:red'>harvest</span>the information you share and use your identity to apply for new bank cards in your name. </p><p id=p144>Fortunately, there are things you can do to protect your privacy online — both within the sites themselves and by using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-14' style='color:red'>Trend</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-15' style='color:red'>Privacy</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-16' style='color:red'>Scanner.</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-17' style='color:red'>Micro's</span>take a look. </p><p id=p176>Changing your </p><p id=p180>You can manually <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-18' style='color:red'>configure</span>your Privacy Settings on sites including <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-19' style='color:red'>Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-20' style='color:red'>more,</span>as well as in your browser.

In addition, anywhere you're able to share your status updates, photos and other posts, there's an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-30' style='color:red'>"audience selector"</span>which allows you to specify whether they can be seen by the Public (anyone on or off Facebook), Friends, or just you. Be aware that Facebook remembers your most recent setting. </p><p id=p333>The amount of data you share with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-31' style='color:red'>apps</span>is also increasingly important to users.

If you want to manually review what info your Facebook apps can access, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-34' style='color:red'>click </span>in the top right, click Settings, then go to Apps and Websites on the left-hand side. You can choose between Active, Expired or Removed <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-35' style='color:red'>websites/apps</span>and remove those you no longer wish to access your personal data. </p><p id=p444>Twitter: </p><p id=p445>As mentioned in the previous blog, Twitter is easier to manage than Facebook, but there are some settings users may prefer to enhance their privacy.

Similarly, there are options to remove your geolocation, not allow users to tag you in photos, or let others find you by email address/phone number. Also switch personalization off to stop sharing data with advertisers and switch off Receive Direct Messages from anyone to avoid spam direct messages. </p><p id=p559>Browser (Chrome on Windows): </p><p id=p563>As the most popular browser in the world, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-37' style='color:red'>Google</span>Chrome tracks and sells much of your activity to advertisers as well as sharing it with other Google products.

You'll need to do the same at work or for other machines. </p><p id=p642>The browser also shares information with various other services. If you're not happy with that happening, you can toggle them off by going to Settings, Advanced (at the bottom of the page). However, enabling Do Not Track will help prevent <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-40' style='color:red'>third-party</span>sites storing your data, although it's not 100% effective. It's also a good idea to keep on the service protecting you and your device from dangerous sites. </p><p id=p710><span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-41' style='color:red'>Click</span>on "content settings" to dive into additional privacy settings. Go into <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-42' style='color:red'>Cookies</span>and "keep local data until you quit your browser" to limit what data sites can harvest from you. Finally, consider using a password manager from a third-party expert like Trend Micro instead of storing your passwords in the browser, since it's far more secure. </p><p id=p767>Automate Privacy Settings with </p><p id=p775>If you want an easier way to manage your privacy on social media and browsers, consider the Trend Micro Privacy Scanner feature, which is available within <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-43' style='color:red'>Trend Micro Security</span>Windows and Mac, and within Mobile Security on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-44' style='color:red'>Android</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-45' style='color:red'>iOS.</span>While we can't help you with all your social network settings, we can certainly help you with quick and easy fixes on four major platforms, as well as their linked apps, and in Windows browsers. </p><p id=p851>For Windows, the social networks covered are Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn, as well as Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox browsers.

And it works on Android (for Facebook) and iOS (for Facebook and Twitter). It's turned on by default in Trend Micro Internet, Maximum and Premium Security and can also be launched from the Trend Micro Toolbar. Either click on the Privacy icon in the Console, or in the browser, select the Trend Micro Toolbar and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-92-47' style='color:red'>"Check your Online Privacy."</span>are a few scenarios: </p><p id=p951>Facebook on Windows </p><p id=p954>A Facebook sign-in page is shown by default by the Privacy Scanner. Sign-in and then See Scan Results. Click Fix All and then Fix to fix all the issues highlighted, or click the drop down to tackle them individually. You can also view any apps here which may have privacy concerns. If you want to fix each separately click "Who can see each app and its posts?" </p><p id=p1021>Once that has been completed you will get a message saying your friends' accounts need help.

It's worth considering as an alternative to storing your online credentials in the browser, which exposes them to hackers.
