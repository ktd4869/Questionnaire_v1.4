The website is not giving a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-28' style='color:red'>clear</span>answer about whether or not your data may have been affected, but making it clear to those who were not exposed. It's confusing. </p><p id=p386>What Would Be Hackers Next Move? </p><p id=p392>With this data in hand, it's most likely that hackers are already selling your personal information on the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-29' style='color:red'>dark web</span>attempting to extort the company, like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-30' style='color:red'>criminals</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-31' style='color:red'>cyber</span>in most massive data breach cases. </p><p id=p428>The Game of Thrones hackers did the same by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-32' style='color:red'>leaking upcoming</span>of the widely watched show after HBO refused to their $6 Million ransom demand for the 1.5 terabytes of data they claimed to have stolen from the company. </p><p id=p468>Same happened to Netflix in April this year when the company refused to meet 50 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-33' style='color:red'>Bitcoins</span>ransom demand of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-34' style='color:red'>hacking</span>group calling itself The Dark Overlord, which then leaked 10 back-to-back episodes of the Season 5 premiere of Netflix's "Orange Is the New Black." </p><p id=p513>Although Equifax has not yet confirmed whether the hackers have contacted the company for any demand or not, the breach is major, and all 143 Million Americans <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-35' style='color:red'>quickly</span>need to take <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-36' style='color:red'>action</span>to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-146-37' style='color:red'>protect</span>themselves and their loved ones. </p><p id=p552>Here's what all you can do to Protect Yourself: </p><p id=p561>1.
