<p id=p0>Today, two of the most important agencies working on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-0' style='color:red'>cybersecurity</span>in the UK issued their latest assessment of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-1' style='color:red'>cyberthreat</span>to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-2' style='color:red'>business.</span>The report by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the newly formed National Cyber Security Centre <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-3' style='color:red'>(NCSC)</span>judges the threat to business as serious and growing, with particular concern about the prevalence of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-4' style='color:red'>ransomware.</span></p><p id=p56>Don't Just Listen – ActA joint report from these two bodies is extremely influential in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-5' style='color:red'>educating</span>organisations and changing the debate around <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-6' style='color:red'>threats</span>to one that encourages organisations to embrace cybersecurity and adopt a preventative posture. If embraced properly, it can contribute to how businesses, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-7' style='color:red'>governmental</span>bodies and everyday <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-8' style='color:red'>users</span>keep closer pace with the threats they face today. </p><p id=p115>But for the NCA and NCSC report to have impact, people and organisations must take this broad insight and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-9' style='color:red'>personalise</span>it, not just file it for future reference. This entails looking at which elements are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-10' style='color:red'>relevant</span>to them and what personal or business impact it would have, so organisations and individuals can take appropriate steps to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-11' style='color:red'>manage</span>the risks. </p><p id=p174>There is context for this to happen, of course. While the EU General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in 2018 and codifies the need for ongoing assessment of the risks and application of relevant state-of-the-art cybersecurity controls, businesses and users should be applying these principles today. </p><p id=p220><span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-12' style='color:red'>Ransomware</span>Is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-13' style='color:red'>Growing</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-14' style='color:red'>Evolving</span>– Businesses Must Keep PaceNotwithstanding the report's warnings, ransomware is still in its relative infancy, yet its evident scope to impact all organisations, rather than just such traditional targets of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-15' style='color:red'>cybercrime</span>as financial services, means we should expect it to grow. In the last year, we have seen ransomware start to leverage targeted <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-16' style='color:red'>techniques</span>with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-17' style='color:red'>SamSa,</span>which has been developed in previous years by nation-state <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-18' style='color:red'>attacks. Most</span>recently new variants, like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-19' style='color:red'>RanRan,</span>have broadened beyond just financial motives to include political motives that blackmail victims into completing the requests to drive propaganda. In today's increasingly digitally dependent world, businesses should be cognizant of these trends. Strategies built on preventing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-20' style='color:red'>attacks,</span>rather than just cleaning up afterwards, are essential to significantly reduce these threats. </p><p id=p345>No report's findings in the field of assessing cybercrime is ever going to be fixed. Quite simply, we need to operate on the principle that threats keep on evolving. It's important to apply this maxim, not just to how <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-21' style='color:red'>cyberattackers</span>are changing approaches, but also to how our own use of technology to make our organisations function and flourish is evolving too. As such we must regularly review where and how cyberthreat information is shared. </p><p id=p420>According to the report, the rapid adoption of business and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-22' style='color:red'>consumer</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-23' style='color:red'>cloud</span>services and devices, such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-24' style='color:red'>wearables</span>that share information, can provide attackers with insight into our lifestyles that could be used against us. But it is equally important to focus on how these could be sources to tap into business data that may not be recognized as a threat. For example, while many businesses have significant controls around their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-25' style='color:red'>cloud storage</span>be a weak point, with businesses often not clear on where and why they are being used. </p><p id=p513>Stealing <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-26' style='color:red'>credentials</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-27' style='color:red'>genuine</span>still one of the most common motives for attackers, as with these, an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-28' style='color:red'>adversary</span>can <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-29' style='color:red'>bypass</span>the entire <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-30' style='color:red'>attack lifecycle</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-31' style='color:red'>impersonating</span>a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-32' style='color:red'>user,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-33' style='color:red'>valid</span>uninterrupted throughout the organization's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-34' style='color:red'>network,</span>and shift to the abuse of credentials from within. Where data is stored outside the business, awareness of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-35' style='color:red'>credential</span>misuse can often go <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-36' style='color:red'>undetected. Cyber risk prevention</span>start with visibility of your continually evolving <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-37' style='color:red'>IT</span>space and examining where you can reduce your risks by reducing the potential attack surface you expose. </p><p id=p600>Industry Collaboration Is KeyAs <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-38' style='color:red'>government</span>bodies collaborate more closely, so should our industry. In recent years, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-39' style='color:red'>CISP</span>has been a great initiative for cyberthreat intelligence sharing between UK organizations. It is also great to see how the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-40' style='color:red'>Cyber Threat Alliance</span>driving collaboration between security <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-41' style='color:red'>vendors</span>to better work together and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-42' style='color:red'>automate</span>sharing. Importantly this is not just the sharing of threats that are seen, but also the blocking of controls and context about the attackers. </p><p id=p676>Returning to the goals of the NCSC, the forces of collaboration, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-158-43' style='color:red'>crowdsourcing</span>intelligence and cybersecurity computer power are going to be critical to success in fighting the threats we face. Like any movement for change, it's essential to begin at the grass roots, getting every business and indeed individual to recognize their role and responsibility, and what value they add into the process of prevention. The more we can work together, the more we can move unknown high-risk attacks into known attacks that are prevented or contained effectively. The role of vendors like Palo Alto Networks is to simplify this process, so cybersecurity and prevention are instinctive, even automatic, behaviours to how we run our economy and live our lives digitally.
