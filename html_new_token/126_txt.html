That was the day unidentified crooks sent at least $205,000 of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-3' style='color:red'>practice's</span>money to nearly a dozen individuals around the country. </p><p id=p87>Eric Hudkins, the office manager and husband of one of the dentists at Smile Zone, said the money was taken in 11 different transfers, including three <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-4' style='color:red'>large wires.</span>again, it seems the attack was carried out with the help of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-5' style='color:red'>money mules,</span>or unwitting individuals hired through work-at-home job schemes over the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-6' style='color:red'>Internet</span>and lured into helping the attackers <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-7' style='color:red'>launder</span>the stolen money. </p><p id=p152>"I've got the names, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-8' style='color:red'>account numbers,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-9' style='color:red'>phone numbers</span>most of  them, and have even looked some of them up on Facebook," Hudkins said of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-10' style='color:red'>co-conspirators.</span>"The bank talked to two of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-11' style='color:red'>[mule]</span>account holders and asked them why  they <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-12' style='color:red'>opened the account,</span>it was for, that kind of thing. Both of  them said they'd had their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-13' style='color:red'>resumes</span>out on careerbuilder.com or  monster.com and that someone they'd never met contacted them and offered  to help them make some money." </p><p id=p240>Hudkins said he contacted the FBI, and that the agent he spoke with  told him the FBI wouldn't open a case on the theft unless it was over  $500,000 in losses. As it stands, he was told, his case would be lumped into a  group of similar investigations that is being run out of an FBI task force in  Omaha, Nebraska. It also appears there is little appetite for  prosecuting the money mules, he said. </p><p id=p320>"The FBI said prosecuting these <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-14' style='color:red'>[mules]</span>for doing anything wrong  is near impossible," Hudkins said. </p><p id=p336>Meanwhile, Smile Zone's bank — Springfield, Mo. -based Great Southern Bank — maintains it is not responsible for the loss, according to Hudkins, although he said the bank is still trying to reverse some of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-15' style='color:red'>transfers.</span>I spoke briefly with a representative of Great Southern on Monday, but received the standard "we don't discuss our customers activities" reply. </p><p id=p395>Businesses do not enjoy the same protections afforded to consumers hit by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-16' style='color:red'>online fraud.</span>credit cards, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-17' style='color:red'>liability</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-18' style='color:red'>consumer</span>generally capped at $50.

But waiting longer than that can costs consumers up to $500 (the liability is unlimited if a consumer waits more than 60 days to report the fraud). </p><p id=p485>Businesses have no such protection from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-20' style='color:red'>fraudulent</span>transfers. Generally speaking, banks will work with commercial customers to try and reverse any  fraudulent transfers, but the chances of that succeeding diminish rapidly after the first 24 hours following unauthorized activity. What's  more, banks are under no obligation to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-21' style='color:red'>reimburse</span>commercial customers victimized by this type of </p><p id=p545>Hudkins said Great Southern required only that customers provide the proper user name and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-126-22' style='color:red'>password</span>to access their accounts online and to move money. The bank does require customers to correctly answer one or challenge questions if it detects a customer is logging in from an unfamiliar Internet address.
