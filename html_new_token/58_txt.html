However, the expert noted that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-58-36' style='color:red'>exploiting</span>the flaw is not easy and there are no public <span class='token pointer' id='tok-58-37' style='color:red'>exploits</span>available for it. </p><p id=p241>The vulnerabilities were reported to Intel <span class='token pointer' id='tok-58-38' style='color:red'>Security</span>in early June 2015.

Those are simple enough that they could even be deduced from the information within the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-58-48' style='color:red'>workaround</span>section alone," SEC Consult team lead Johannes Greil told SecurityWeek. </p><p id=p408>Intel Security Disagrees </p><p id=p411>SEC Consult said Intel Security initially planned to release a fix for the confirmed vulnerabilities in the third quarter of 2015, but the promised update has not been made available. </p><p id=p441>Intel Security published an advisory this week to explain why the issues reported by SEC Consult are either not vulnerabilities or are considered low risk flaws. </p><p id=p467>"Upon learning of the researchers' concerns last summer, we promptly investigated the scenarios posed. We found that customers following our <span class='token pointer' id='tok-58-49' style='color:red'>standard deployment configuration guidance</span>not subject to these scenarios," Intel Security representatives told SecurityWeek. </p><p id=p502>Intel Security believes the issues only impact McAfee Application Control 6.1.3.353, and that no other McAfee products are affected. The company has pointed customers to a document describing security best practices for McAfee Application Control. </p><p id=p537>The vendor has released a McAfee Application Control update this week to address <span class='token pointer' id='tok-58-50' style='color:red'>DoS,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-58-51' style='color:red'>input validation and privilege escalation</span>reported by Shannon Sabens from HP TippingPoint. </p><p id=p564>SEC Consult says it hasn't been able to verify if the update addresses any of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-58-52' style='color:red'>flaws</span>they have reported.

"For such systems it's not enough to solely rely on a security layer such as application whitelisting. Rather, the underlying security of the system itself must be increased. We do not see a reason for not using application whitelisting if the software is secure and doesn't tear holes in the overall system security but it's important to understand that it doesn't replace robust security measures."
