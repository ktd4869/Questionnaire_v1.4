One is called a public key and other is called a private key. A public key is used to encrypt data whereas a private key is used to decrypt that data. Similar to symmetric cryptography, the smallest change in any of the two keys will make them useless to get the original data. A benefit of asymmetric cryptography is that you can share the public key with the whole world so that they can use it to send you encrypted data. And the private key is stored safely with the owner and is used for decryption. One disadvantage of this type of cryptography is that if your private key is lost or leaked then you will have to generate a new pair of public and private keys. </p><p id=p295>Why do we need quantum cryptography? </p><p id=p301>Every new solution is made because of some problem we have with the current solution. The case is no different with this one. Let us see the problem first. </p><p id=p330>The problem with symmetric cryptography is that the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the messages. If for some reason that key is leaked to some third party, then it can be used to decrypt communication between two trusted devices or persons. In the worst case, the communication can be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-22' style='color:red'>intercepted</span>and altered. Today's huge computing power (these days even Xbox and PlayStation at homes have huge power) can be used to crack a key used in symmetric cryptography. Another major problem with this type of cryptography is how to decide which key to use and how to share between trusted devices or persons. Imagine a key has to be shared between India and America, then that communication too has to be secured before sharing the key. </p><p id=p460>Coming to the problem of asymmetric cryptography, it is not something we are facing right now, but seeing the pace of changing technology, we will be facing it soon. Most of the keys used in public key cryptography are at least <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-23' style='color:red'>128-bit keys</span>are considered to be very strong. An attacker can easily get hold of the public key because it is shared by the user. But to generate a private key for that public key involves huge amounts of calculations with <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-24' style='color:red'>permutations</span>and combinations. At present a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-25' style='color:red'>supercomputer</span>is what you need to crack a PKC and many years to complete it. But it will become pretty much possible with the use of quantum computers which use quantum physics to operate and have very high efficiency and computation speed. A quantum computer is a theoretical concept right now and will utilize atoms and molecules to perform computing at a very high speed. </p><p id=p614>According to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-26' style='color:red'>integrated</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-27' style='color:red'>Moore's Law, in an</span>the number of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-28' style='color:red'>transistors</span>doubles every 2 years. It means that the speed of computing will increase to a very high level every two years. Right now Intel i7 processor integrated circuit has 1.4 billion transistors. Clearly, in the coming decades computing speed will increase and the age of quantum computers will become a reality. </p><p id=p677>Now from our above discussion it is very clear that the biggest problem with the current cryptographic techniques is keys and their security in transmission. </p><p id=p702>Ethical Hacking Training – Resources (InfoSec) </p><p id=p708>How does quantum cryptography work? </p><p id=p713>In quantum cryptography, the source sends a key to the receiver, and this key can be used to decrypt any future messages that are to be sent. When the key has been successfully sent and received, the next step is to send encrypted data to the receiver and let it decrypt and process that data. </p><p id=p768>Important: the key is the main part of cryptography and should be sent in a very secure manner. </p><p id=p786>Quantum cryptography has a different way of sending the key to the receiver. It uses photons to send a key. </p><p id=p806>What is a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-29' style='color:red'>photon,</span>and how it is used? </p><p id=p815>A photon is the smallest particle of light.

How do we use it in cryptography? Another part of physics and photons is polarization. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-33' style='color:red'>Polarization</span>can be used to polarize (pass through a filter) a photon so that it has a particular spin, vertical or horizontal or diagonal. Polarization of a photon is performed using polarization filters. </p><p id=p896>Now comes Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that it is impossible to measure together the speed and position of a particle with highest accuracy, and its state will change when measured. In other words, if an eavesdropper intercepts the transmitted photons and passes it through its <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-34' style='color:red'>polarizer,</span>if it is wrong it will make the receiver get the wrong photon. Hence the interception of communication will get detected. </p><p id=p964>It means that if a photon is polarized using say <span class='token pointer' id='tok-24-35' style='color:red'>X filter (Diagonal Polarization), then</span>get the original spin of the photon only X filter can be used.
