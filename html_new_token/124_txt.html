When enough stories emerged of companies like Netflix out-innovating Blockbuster (leading to the latter's demise), it tends to draw attention.  </p><p id=p202>As cloud has crept into the enterprise, it has displaced some, but not all of the traditional computing environment. In many cases, IT organizations cannot abandon <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-18' style='color:red'>legacy</span>investments without introducing unacceptable risk and cost. Thus, we have this uneasy aggregation of cloud and traditional computing, referred to as Hybrid IT by Gartner in a blog post dating back to 2012. </p><p id=p262>Why the status quo must change </p><p id=p268>The impact of running cloud and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-19' style='color:red'>traditional services</span>parallel in the enterprise is most painfully felt within application development teams and IT operations. As long as cloud and traditional services operate independently, there is a division that increases management complexity and reduces the agility of the organization, impacting the overall competitive posture of the business. </p><p id=p324>From an application development perspective: </p><p id=p329>● The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-20' style='color:red'>deployment pipelines</span>multiple cloud and legacy services are highly segregated. Where services are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-21' style='color:red'>redundant,</span>the enterprise misses out on potential volume discounting and efficiency gains. </p><p id=p356><span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-22' style='color:red'>● Cloud-based services</span>need access to rigid <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-23' style='color:red'>legacy systems.</span>dependency creates a flexibility mismatch that reduces the speed and agility benefits of cloud computing. </p><p id=p381>  </p><p id=p382>Segregation worked for a while when DevOps initiatives were <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-24' style='color:red'>small-scale experiments</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-25' style='color:red'>cloud-provided</span>tools. But as DevOps scales out across the enterprise, deployments will slow to a crawl if IT operations cannot abstract the provisioning differences and dependencies between the various <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-26' style='color:red'>computing platforms</span>make up Hybrid IT. </p><p id=p430>From the perspective of IT operations and security, there are several challenges: </p><p id=p442>● Management is divided in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-27' style='color:red'>silos</span>defined by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-28' style='color:red'>computing platform,</span>multiple teams and tools. This increases complexity, costs and errors while slowing operations and frustrating users. </p><p id=p468>● Services delivered on legacy platforms are often unable to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-29' style='color:red'>elastically</span>respond to peaks or decline in demand, in the same way that cloud services can. </p><p id=p493><span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-30' style='color:red'>●  IT</span>operations models based on manual management of changes and configurations cannot scale to the pace demanded by the business. As process is bypassed, potential <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-31' style='color:red'>security policy and compliance violations</span></p><p id=p524>IT operations and security teams are experiencing a lack of control introduced by cloud services, which might be fine by the purveyors of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-124-32' style='color:red'>"NoOps,"</span>but enterprises have standards for availability and regulations that cannot be ignored without severe consequences. As the use of cloud services accelerates in the enterprise, we can expect these challenges to grow. </p><p id=p580>Getting to a strategic approach to Hybrid IT </p><p id=p588>A strategic approach to Hybrid IT means enabling the choice of environment for a workload to be made entirely based on what is best for the business.
