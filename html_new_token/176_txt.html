<p id=p0>It's that time of year again when we look back at the past year and try to anticipate what we can expect in the coming year. I spend most of my time <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-0' style='color:red'>analyzing</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-1' style='color:red'>quantities</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-2' style='color:red'>vast</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-3' style='color:red'>data,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-4' style='color:red'>threat</span>for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-5' style='color:red'>trends</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-6' style='color:red'>intel</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-7' style='color:red'>creating</span>gives customers <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-8' style='color:red'>critical insights</span>better prepare for what <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-9' style='color:red'>threats</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-10' style='color:red'>cyber</span>on the horizon. With that context, here is my <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-11' style='color:red'>cybersecurity</span>forecast for 2018. </p><p id=p70>1. In 2018, individuals and organizations will learn the hard way <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-12' style='color:red'>identifiers</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-13' style='color:red'>personal</span>not be used as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-14' style='color:red'>authenticators. </span></p><p id=p88>Despite long-held and widespread confusion among most organizations, there is an important difference between an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-15' style='color:red'>identifier</span>and an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-16' style='color:red'>authenticator.</span>Information used as a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-17' style='color:red'>personal identifier</span>be things like a social <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-18' style='color:red'>security</span>number, a driver's license number and even an address. An authenticator can be a question that, when answered correctly, proves you are who you say you are. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-19' style='color:red'>Knowledge-based authentication</span>questions like what is your high school mascot. What was your first car? <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-20' style='color:red'>Or, they could be based</span>credit report data and a multitude of other <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-21' style='color:red'>possibilities</span>that are often used as cheap authenticators as opposed to more expensive but more secure options such as </p><p id=p199>Unfortunately, too many organizations use identifiers as authenticators and massive <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-22' style='color:red'>breaches</span>like Equifax tell us this will be an even bigger problem in 2018. Equifax stored numerous personal identifiers on millions of individuals and the theft of that information puts <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-23' style='color:red'>personally identifiable information (PII)</span>every one of them at risk, particularly at organizations who use identifiers as authenticators. As an example, think of when you call your bank and they ask for  the last four digits of your social, name, date of birth…. all of those are identifiers, not authenticators.  How many <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-24' style='color:red'>hackers</span>now have that information as a result of Equifax? In 2018, individuals and organizations alike will learn this lesson again, the hard way. The most important solution to this problem is for organizations to stop using identifiers as authenticators. </p><p id=p332><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-25' style='color:red'>2. Partnerships,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-26' style='color:red'>supply chain</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-27' style='color:red'>as-a-service</span>relationships will give rise to more breaches next year. </p><p id=p346>Business is increasingly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-28' style='color:red'>digital</span>and savvy organizations are extending their reach and offering customer convenience via <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-29' style='color:red'>partnerships,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-30' style='color:red'>integration</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-31' style='color:red'>supply chain</span>the use of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-32' style='color:red'>as-a-service functionality.</span>an increasingly popular <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-33' style='color:red'>business acceleration</span>this extensive <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-34' style='color:red'>outsourcing</span>can also be a security nightmare. Deloitte and Booz Allen fell victim to this in 2017 and we will see more breaches that are the result of attacks via <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-35' style='color:red'>partner networks</span>year. </p><p id=p415>In a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-36' style='color:red'>partnership,</span>organizations share data and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-37' style='color:red'>brand reputation.</span>should develop <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-38' style='color:red'>cyber hygiene best practices</span>expect all partners to follow them. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-39' style='color:red'>contractual</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-40' style='color:red'>Strong</span>should be written, in line with any <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-41' style='color:red'>regulatory requirements,</span>an organization should limit business with a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-42' style='color:red'>potential partner</span>the contract is agreed to and/or build in new language at the time of partnership renewal. Unfortunately, this could mean tough conversations for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-43' style='color:red'>procurement</span>departments. Because these best practice requirements will likely impact budget both for meeting new requirements and enforcing them, organizations need to build this into the year and manage ongoing costs accordingly.   </p><p id=p518>3. Small business healthcare organizations will <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-44' style='color:red'>evolve</span>to be the preferred target of attackers using <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-45' style='color:red'>ransomware</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-46' style='color:red'>extortion</span>in 2018. </p><p id=p537><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-47' style='color:red'>Ransomware</span>will be a consistent line of business for hackers around the globe but the intended targets will become more focused to include <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-48' style='color:red'>SMBs</span>who are less prepared to defend against the attacks. As such, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-49' style='color:red'>ransoms</span>may be lower in amount so smaller organizations are able to pay.  Regional healthcare clinics and hospitals will be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-50' style='color:red'>hardest</span>hit next year, primarily because they are considered to be easy targets by so many. The least amount of effort for the highest payoff is what these 'business people' are after.  </p><p id=p624>4. Organizations will finally begin to prioritize <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-51' style='color:red'>Breach Response</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-52' style='color:red'>Response.</span></p><p id=p635>How many more times do we have to see the "I'm sorry" letter from the CEO before companies look at <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-53' style='color:red'>breach response</span>As cybersecurity climbs the priority list in boardrooms everywhere, organizations are waking up to the fact this is much more than a technical issue. It's an organizational priority and while there will be company blunders for sure, we will start to see better breach response.  </p><p id=p703><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-54' style='color:red'>Incident response</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-55' style='color:red'>IT operations</span>security working to prevent <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-56' style='color:red'>security incidents</span>well as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-57' style='color:red'>remediation</span>when something does happen. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-58' style='color:red'>Breach response</span>much bigger than that – it's how an entire organization responds to a breach that impacts <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-59' style='color:red'>customer data,</span>bottom line numbers impacted by remediation costs to future company reputation. Breach response involves action from the CEO, the board, the legal department, marketing and PR teams, and others.  </p><p id=p774>Equifax is a prime example of how not to handle breach response. The organization made misstep after misstep in a very public spotlight. That negative attention inevitably woke up a few organizations to the reality breach response must be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-60' style='color:red'>prioritized,</span>planned for, and practiced. </p><p id=p818><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-61' style='color:red'>5. Machine learning</span>will become more defined and mature as a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-62' style='color:red'>capability. </span></p><p id=p830><span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-63' style='color:red'>Machine learning</span>a buzzword that means a little something different to everyone, but I expect to see more clarity to this capability in the coming year. The goal of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-64' style='color:red'>machine learning technology</span>to lessen the burden on people and to increase the speed of processing, understanding and acting on overwhelming quantities of data. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-65' style='color:red'>Security technology</span>to advance and we will continue to see better, higher quality data as a result. We are making <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-66' style='color:red'>processing</span>improvements and smarter human response is then possible. Machine learning or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-67' style='color:red'>automation</span>will continue to improve in 2018 and so will the quality of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-68' style='color:red'>threat</span>intelligence data. Combining machine-learning threat intelligence capabilities with human <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-69' style='color:red'>experts</span>who can provide analysis, insights and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-70' style='color:red'>recommendations</span>is the best of both worlds so to speak. </p><p id=p958>TweetAdam Meyer is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-176-71' style='color:red'>Chief Security Strategist</span>SurfWatch Labs.
