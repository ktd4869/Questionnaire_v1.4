Image: <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-9' style='color:red'>DNI</span></p><p id=p45>The 25-page dossier from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stopped short of saying the Russians succeeded at influencing the outcome of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-10' style='color:red'>election,</span>noting that the report did not attempt to make an assessment on that front. But it makes the case that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-11' style='color:red'>"Russia's</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-12' style='color:red'>cyber operations</span>targets associated with the 2016 US presidential election, including targets associated with both major US political parties." </p><p id=p115>"We assess with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-13' style='color:red'>Guccifer 2.0 persona</span>DCLeaks.com to release US victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks," the DNI report reads. </p><p id=p163>The report is a quick and fascinating read. One example: It includes a fairly detailed <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-14' style='color:red'>appendix</span>which concludes that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-15' style='color:red'>the U.S.-based</span>Kremlin-financed media outlet RT (formerly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-16' style='color:red'>Russia</span>Today) is little more than a propaganda machine controlled by Russian intelligence agencies. </p><p id=p204>"Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations—such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-17' style='color:red'>cyber activity—with</span>efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-18' style='color:red'>third-party intermediaries,</span>paid social media users or 'trolls,'" reads the report. </p><p id=p240>The DNI report is remarkable for several reasons. First, it publicly accuses Russia's President of trying to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-19' style='color:red'>meddle with the U.S. election and</span>hack both political parties. Also, as The New York Times observed, it offers "a virtually unheard-of, real-time <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-20' style='color:red'>revelation</span>by the American intelligence agencies that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-21' style='color:red'>legitimacy</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-22' style='color:red'>undermined the</span>the president who is about to direct them." </p><p id=p298>However, those who've been clamoring for more technical evidence to support a conclusion that Russian intelligence agencies were behind the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-23' style='color:red'>phishing,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-24' style='color:red'>malware attacks</span>email leaks at The Democratic National Committee <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-25' style='color:red'>(DNC)</span>and Clinton campaign likely will be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-26' style='color:red'>unmoved by this report.</span>details will remain safely hidden from public view in the classified version of the report. </p><p id=p356>Last week, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-27' style='color:red'>report (PDF)</span>on some of the malware and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-28' style='color:red'>Internet resources</span>in the DNC intrusion. But many experts criticized it as a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-29' style='color:red'>poorly-written, jumbled collection</span>threat indicators and digital clues that didn't all quite lead where they should. </p><p id=p405>Others were <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-30' style='color:red'>perplexed</span>by the high confidence level the agencies assigned to the findings in their unclassified report, noting that neither the FBI nor DHS examined the DNC hard drives that were compromised in the break-in (that work was done by private security firm Crowdstrike). </p><p id=p450>Former <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-31' style='color:red'>black-hat hacker</span>Wired and Daily Beast contributing editor Kevin Poulsen slammed the FBI/DHS report as "so aimless that it <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-32' style='color:red'>muddies</span>the clear public evidence that Russia <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-33' style='color:red'>hacked</span>the Democratic Party to affect the election, and so wrong it enables the Trump-friendly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-34' style='color:red'>conspiracy</span>theorists trying to explain away that evidence." </p><p id=p501>Granted, trying to reconstruct a digital crime <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-35' style='color:red'>scene</span>absent some of the most important pieces of evidence is a bit like attempting to assemble a jigsaw puzzle with only half of the pieces. But as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-36' style='color:red'>digital forensics</span>security expert Jonanthan Zdziarksi noted via Twitter last night, good old fashioned spying and human intelligence seems to have played a bigger role in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-37' style='color:red'>pinning</span>the DNC hack on the Russians. </p><p id=p569>"The DNI report subtly implied that more weight was put on our intelligence coming from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-38' style='color:red'>espionage</span>operations than on cyber <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-39' style='color:red'>warfare,"</span>Zdziarski wrote. "As someone who's publicly called out the FBI over misleading the public and the court system, I believe the DNI report to be reliable. I also believe @CrowdStrike's findings to be reliable based on the people there and their experience with threat intelligence." </p><p id=p634>Key findings from the DNI report. </p><p id=p640>My take? Virtually nothing in the DNI report is dispositive of anything in the FBI/DHS report. In other words, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-40' style='color:red'>the DNI</span>report probably won't change anyone's minds. I'm sure that many smart U.S. intelligence analysts spent a great deal of time on this, but none of it was particularly surprising at all: The DNI report describes <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-41' style='color:red'>precisely the</span>kind of cloak and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-42' style='color:red'>dagger</span>stuff that one might expect the Kremlin to be doing to the United States, day-in and day-out. </p><p id=p717>What makes these kinds of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-43' style='color:red'>cyber espionage and propaganda campaigns</span>worthwhile is that even if the Kremlin cannot always get its favorite candidate elected, Moscow may still consider it a success if it can continuously sow doubt in the minds of Americans about the legitimacy of the U.S. election process and other tenets of democracy. </p><p id=p773>It's also exactly the sort of thing the U.S. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-44' style='color:red'>government</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-45' style='color:red'>has</span>been doing to other countries for decades. In fact, the U.S. has done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-46' style='color:red'>amassed</span>by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University, writes Nina Agrawal for The Los Angeles Times. </p><p id=p828>Anyone shocked by the Kremlin-funded news station RT in all of this probably never heard of Voice of America, a U.S. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-47' style='color:red'>government-funded</span>news service that broadcast the American response to Soviet propaganda during the Cold War. </p><p id=p864><span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-48' style='color:red'>President-elect</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-49' style='color:red'>Trump has</span>publicly mocked <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-50' style='color:red'>American intelligence assessments that</span>meddled with the U.S. election on his behalf, and said recently that he doubts the U.S. government can be certain it was hackers backed by the Russian <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-51' style='color:red'>government who</span>hacked and leaked emails from the DNC. </p><p id=p908>Mr. Trump issued a statement last night only loosely acknowledging Russian involvement, saying that "while Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-52' style='color:red'>consistently</span>trying to break through the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-53' style='color:red'>cyber institutions,</span>and organizations including the Democrat [sic] National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-54' style='color:red'>tampering</span>whatsoever with the voting machines." </p><p id=p971>Trump also <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-55' style='color:red'>has called</span>for a review of the nation's plans to stop <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-56' style='color:red'>cyberattacks,</span>which he said will be completed within 90 days of his taking office on Jan. 20. </p><p id=p1000>"Whether it is our government, organizations, associations or businesses we need to aggressively <span class='token pointer' id='tok-4-57' style='color:red'>combat</span>and stop cyberattacks," Trump said. "I will appoint a team to give me a plan within 90 days of taking office. The methods, tools and tactics we use to keep America safe should not be a public discussion that will benefit those who seek to do us harm. Two weeks from today I will take the oath of office and America's safety and security will be my number one priority."
