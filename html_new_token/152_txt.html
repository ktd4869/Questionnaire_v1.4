Since the organization will most likely use the selected solution for many years, the RFP is a critical document and, when reviewing it, the auditor should: </p><p id=p271>validate the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-152-20' style='color:red'>completeness</span>and accuracy of the requirements through interviews and desk research,confirm the RFP has been fully approved by legal and senior IS and business managers, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-152-21' style='color:red'>andensure</span>enough quality vendors have been invited to respond.Project managementCandidates must understand how project management tools and techniques are used to manage the risks associated with IS acquisition, development, and implementation, and should be able to evaluate if projects are progressing to plan and are on track to deliver the benefits contained in the business case. </p><p id=p354>Attention must be paid to the project brief and project plan.
