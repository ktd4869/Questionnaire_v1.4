"Because of all the different breaches, the states and the IRS have been taking extreme measures to filter, filter, filter. And each time we'd get news of an additional breach, we'd start over, reprogram our fraud filters, and re-assess those returns that were not processed fully yet and those waiting to be processed." </p><p id=p436>Magee said the Gentax <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-28' style='color:red'>software</span>assigns each tax return a score for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-29' style='color:red'>"wage confidence"</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-30' style='color:red'>"identity confidence,"</span>that usually <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-31' style='color:red'>fraudulent tax</span>refund requests have high wage confidence but low — if any — identity confidence. That's because the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-32' style='color:red'>fraudsters</span>are filing refund requests on taxpayers for whom they already have stolen W2 information. The identity confidence in these cases is low often because the fraudsters are asking to have the money electronically deposited into an account that can't be directly tied to the taxpayer, or they have incorrectly supplied some of the victim's data. </p><p id=p530>"I have zero confidence that filings which match this pattern are legitimate," Magee said. "It's early still, but our new filtering system seems to be working. But it's still a big unknown about the percentage of fraudulent refunds we're not stopping." </p><p id=p571>MORE <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-33' style='color:red'>W2 PHISHING VICTIMS Most</span>didn't start processing returns until after March 1, which is exactly when a flood of data breaches related to phished employee W2 data began washing up. As <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-34' style='color:red'>KrebsOnSecurity</span>first warned in mid-February, thieves have been sending targeted phishing emails to human resources and finance employees at countless organizations, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-35' style='color:red'>spoofing a message</span>the CEO requesting all employee W2's in PDF format. </p><p id=p638>In Magee's own state, W2 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-36' style='color:red'>phishers</span>hauled in tax data on an estimated 180 employees of ISCO Industries in Huntsville, and some 425 employees at the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-37' style='color:red'>EWTN</span>Global Catholic Network in Irondale, Ala. But those are just the ones that have been made public. Magee's office only learned of those breaches after employees at the affected organizations reached out to journalists who then wrote about the compromises. </p><p id=p705>Over the past week, KrebsOnSecurity similarly has heard from employees at a broad range of organizations that appear to have fallen victim to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-38' style='color:red'>W2 phishing scams,</span>some 28,000 employees of the market research giant Kantar Group; 17,000+ employees of Sprouts Farmer's Market; call center software provider <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-39' style='color:red'>backup software</span>Acronis; Kids Dental Kare in Los Angeles; Century Fence, a fencing company in Wisconsin; Nation's Lending Corporation, a mortgage lending firm in Independent, Ohio; QTI Group, a Wisconsin-based human resources consulting company; and the jousting-and-feasting entertainment company Medieval Times. </p><p id=p794>TAX FRAUDSTERS GOING <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-40' style='color:red'>PRO?Magee said</span>and other states are dealing with a huge spike this year in fraudulent refund requests filed via criminals who use online software firms that specialize in selling <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-41' style='color:red'>e-filing services</span>tax professionals. </p><p id=p831>According to Magee, crooks first register with the IRS as "electronic return originators." EROs are typically accountants or tax preparation firms authorized by the IRS to prepare and transmit tax returns for people and companies electronically. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-42' style='color:red'>Magee said</span>have been registering as EROs and then buying tax preparation software and services from firms like PETZ Enterprises to push through large numbers of phony refund requets. </p><p id=p897>"The biggest move [in refund fraud] this year is in the so-called <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-43' style='color:red'>'professional services applications,'</span>are being flagged in high rates this year for fraud," Magee said. "And that's not just Alabama. A great number of other states are seeing the same thing. We have always had fraud in that area, but we're seeing significantly higher rates of fraud there now." </p><p id=p958>Magee said tax software prep firms should be required to conduct more due diligence on their clients. </p><p id=p974>"In the state of Alabama, you need a license to cut someone's hair, to be a barber or a cosmetologist, but anyone can become a tax preparation professional with no certification at all," Magee said. "The software firms are where all the fraud is going now. The criminal becomes an ERO, and then he can just sit there all day and file an unlimited number of fraudulent returns." </p><p id=p1040>PETZ did not respond to requests for comment. But Stephen Ryan, a lobbyist for the industry group American Coalition for Taxpayer Rights, said states are free to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-44' style='color:red'>regulate</span>tax providers as they see fit. </p><p id=p1073>"If there are facts that demonstrate there is a problem such as is being alleged about unscrupulous local preparers using professional software they license, the state certainly has the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-128-45' style='color:red'>sovereign</span>authority to prosecute or regulate this," Ryan said. "If a specific source of fraud or crimes is being locally committed, that's a pretty easy enforcement target to focus upon. And in the unlikely case a state doesn't have that authority, they can seek it from their legislature." </p><p id=p1150>Look for additional stories in the coming days as part of a series on tax refund fraud in 2016.
