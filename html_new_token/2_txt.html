<p id=p0>The U.S. government Wednesday introduced greater transparency into its <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-0' style='color:red'>(VEP)</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-1' style='color:red'>Vulnerabilities Equities Policy</span>This is the process by which government agencies decide whether to disclose or stockpile <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-2' style='color:red'>the cyber vulnerabilities they</span></p><p id=p33>In a lengthy statement, White <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-3' style='color:red'>House Cybersecurity Coordinator</span>Joyce explained why not all discoveries are disclosed. That will not change; but in introducing greater transparency into the process of decision-making, he hopes "to demonstrate to the American people that the Federal Government is carefully weighing the risks and benefits as we carry out this important mission." </p><p id=p90>The extent to which the government agencies use cyber vulnerabilities to further their own overseas missions became known with Edward Snowden's leaked documents. This sparked greater discussion over the morality of government collection and use of vulnerabilities without disclosing the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-4' style='color:red'>existence</span>of those vulnerabilities to the product vendors concerned.  </p><p id=p139>Microsoft, for example, developed detailed proposals for introducing international norms of cyber behavior that would rely on no government keeping private supplies (hoarding) of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-5' style='color:red'>0-day</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-6' style='color:red'>undisclosed</span>and also called for a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-7' style='color:red'>digital Geneva Convention</span>would "mandate that governments report vulnerabilities to vendors rather than stockpile, sell or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-8' style='color:red'>exploit</span>them." This is unlikely to happen. "Our national capacity to find and hold criminals and other rogue actors accountable relies on cyber capabilities enabled by exploiting vulnerabilities in the digital infrastructure they use. Those exploits produce intelligence for attribution, evidence of crimes, enable <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-9' style='color:red'>defensive</span>investigations, and posture us to respond to our adversaries with cyber capabilities," said Joyce in his statement. </p><p id=p250>The theft and release of 'Equation Group' (generally considered to be the NSA) tools and exploits by the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-10' style='color:red'>Shadow Brokers (generally</span>to be 'Russia') brought new emphasis to the issue. These tools included the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-11' style='color:red'>EternalBlue exploit</span>used by hackers (quite probably nation-state affiliated hackers) in the worldwide <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-12' style='color:red'>WannaCry</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-13' style='color:red'>NotPetya</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-14' style='color:red'>ransomware</span>outbreaks. </p><p id=p304>Joyce formerly served as head of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-15' style='color:red'>NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO)</span>offensive hacking team tasked with breaking into systems of foreign entities. </p><p id=p328>The unproven implication is that if the NSA had disclosed their vulnerabilities, the worldwide disruption caused by WannaCry and NotPetya might not have happened. There is, however, little mention of the danger of theft inherent in any store of vulnerabilities in this week's VEP transparency announcement, beyond two considerations in the decision process: "If USG knowledge of this <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-16' style='color:red'>vulnerability</span>were to be revealed, what risks could that pose for USG relationships with industry?", and "If USG knowledge of this vulnerability were to be revealed, what risks could that pose for USG international relations?" </p><p id=p421>The full unclassified VEP process document (PDF) "describes the Vulnerabilities Equities Policy and Process for departments and agencies of the United States Government (USG) to balance equities and make determinations regarding disclosure or restriction when the USG obtains knowledge of newly discovered and not publicly known <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-17' style='color:red'>vulnerabilities in information systems and</span></p><p id=p473>In short, it explains the process without altering the policy. Its purpose is to introduce transparency and reassure the public that the government will weigh the offensive advantages obtained against the threat of public <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-18' style='color:red'>disruption</span>if used by third-parties, for each <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-19' style='color:red'>0-day vulnerability</span>discovers. </p><p id=p518>That transparency is valuable, but there remain numerous concerns. One is that the VEP continues to be an administrative exercise not enshrined in law. It can be changed at any time without public or legislative overview.  </p><p id=p555>In May 2017, Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and U.S. Representatives Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) introduced the 'Protecting Our Ability to Counter Hacking Act of 2017' -- the PATCH Act. </p><p id=p594>Its purpose is to promote the transparency introduced this week, but make it a legal requirement rather than an administrative choice. The Patch Act appears to have stalled, with no real progress since its introduction in May. </p><p id=p631>Other concerns appear in the Exceptions section of the VEP process document. For example, "The United States Government's decision to disclose or restrict vulnerability information could be subject to restrictions by partner agreements and sensitive operations." This will exclude <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-20' style='color:red'>0-days</span>discovered by, say, GCHQ and disclosed to the NSA under an effective non-disclosure agreement; and it could also exclude 0-days expected to be used in potential operations (such <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-21' style='color:red'>Stuxnet).</span></p><p id=p701>It has long been suspected that members of the Five Eyes surveillance alliance share intelligence on each other's nationals to circumvent individual laws <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-22' style='color:red'>forbidding</span>surveillance of own subjects. If this happens in practice, a similar arrangement between each members' intelligence agencies would exclude shared <span class='token pointer' id='tok-2-23' style='color:red'>vulnerabilities from the VEP process.</span>exclusions will undoubtedly be used by the more offense-driven agencies (the NSA and the CIA) to both hold and keep secret their most 'valuable' exploits. </p><p id=p776>Nevertheless, the purpose of declassifying the VEP process is primarily to reassure the American people that the secretive intelligence agencies do not have free rein in the vulnerabilities they keep and the vulnerabilities they use -- and to that extent it will probably succeed. </p><p id=p820>Related: The Increasing Effect of Geopolitics on Cybersecurity  </p><p id=p828>Related: Report Highlights Business Risks Drawn From Geopolitical Flashpoints  </p><p id=p837>Related: Zero-day Conundrum: Keep or Disclose Vulnerability Stockpiles? </p><p id=p845>TweetKevin Townsend is a Senior Contributor at SecurityWeek.
