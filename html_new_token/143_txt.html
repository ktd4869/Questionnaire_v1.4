<p id=p0>Lost amid the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-0' style='color:red'>media</span>firestorm these past few weeks about <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-1' style='color:red'>fraudsters</span>turning to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-2' style='color:red'>Apple Pay</span>this stark and rather unsettling reality: Apple Pay makes it possible for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-3' style='color:red'>cyber thieves</span>buy high-priced merchandise <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-4' style='color:red'>from brick-and-mortar</span>stores using stolen credit and debit card numbers that were <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-5' style='color:red'>heretofore</span>only useful for </p><p id=p49>To understand what's going on here, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-6' style='color:red'>primer</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-7' style='color:red'>a quick</span>card fraud is probably in order. If you're a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-8' style='color:red'>fraudster</span>and you wish to walk into a Best Buy store and walk out with a big screen <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-9' style='color:red'>TV</span>or <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-10' style='color:red'>xBox</span>console on someone else's dime, you're going to buy <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-11' style='color:red'>"dumps,"</span>which are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-12' style='color:red'>data</span>stolen straight off the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-13' style='color:red'>magnetic stripe</span>the backs of cards. </p><p id=p110>Typically, dumps are stolen via <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-14' style='color:red'>malware</span>planted on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-15' style='color:red'>point-of-sale devices,</span>in the breaches at brick-and-mortar stores like Target, Home Depot and countless others over the past year. Dumps buyers <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-16' style='color:red'>encode</span>the data onto new plastic, which they then use "in-store" at retailers and walk out with armloads full of high-priced goods that can be easily resold for cash. The average price of a single <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-17' style='color:red'>dump</span>is between $10-$30, but the payoff in stolen merchandise per card is often many times that amount. </p><p id=p190>When fraudsters want to order something online using stolen credit cards, they go buy what the crooks call <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-18' style='color:red'>"CVVs"</span>— i.e., card data stolen from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-19' style='color:red'>hacked</span>online stores. CVV stands for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-20' style='color:red'>"card verification code,"</span>refers to the three-digit <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-21' style='color:red'>code</span>on the back of cards that's required for most online transactions. Fraudsters buying CVVs get the credit card number, the expiration date, the card verification code, as well as the cardholder's name, address and phone number. Because they're less versatile than dumps, CVVs cost quite a bit less — typically around $1-$5 per stolen account. </p><p id=p283>So in summary, dumps are stolen from main-street merchants, and are sought after by crooks mainly for use at main street merchants. CVVs, on the other hand, are stolen from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-22' style='color:red'>online stores,</span>are useful only for fraud against online stores. </p><p id=p324>Enter Apple Pay, which potentially erases that limitation of CVVs because it allows <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-23' style='color:red'>users</span>to sign up online for an in-store payment method using little more than a hacked <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-24' style='color:red'>iTunes</span>account and CVVs. That's because most banks that are enabling Apple Pay for their customers do little, if anything, to require that customers prove they have the physical card in their possession. </p><p id=p385>Avivah Litan, a fraud analyst with Gartner Inc. explained a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-25' style='color:red'>blog post</span>earlier this month that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-26' style='color:red'>Apple</span>provides banks with a fair amount of data to aid banks in their efforts at <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-27' style='color:red'>"identity proofing"</span>customer, such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-28' style='color:red'>device</span>name, its current <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-29' style='color:red'>geographic</span>location, and whether or not the customer has a long history of transactions with iTunes. </p><p id=p443>All useful <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-30' style='color:red'>data points,</span>course, unless the iTunes account that all of this information is based on is hijacked by fraudsters. And as we know from previous stories on this blog, there is a robust trade in the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-31' style='color:red'>cybercrime</span>underground for hijacked iTunes accounts, which retail for about $8 per account. </p><p id=p493>Litan's column continues: </p><p id=p496>Interestingly, neither Apple nor the banks get any useful identity information out of the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-32' style='color:red'>mobile carriers</span>at least that I know or heard of. And mobile carrier data could be particularly helpful with identity proofing. For example the banks could compare the mobile service's billing address with the card account holder's billing address. </p><p id=p550>For years, we have been briefed by <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-33' style='color:red'>vendors</span>offering a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-34' style='color:red'>plethora</span>of innovative and strong <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-35' style='color:red'>authentication</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-36' style='color:red'>user</span>for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-37' style='color:red'>mobile payments</span>commerce. And for years, we have been asking the vendors touting them how they know their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-38' style='color:red'>app</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-39' style='color:red'>mobile</span>being provisioned to a legitimate <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-40' style='color:red'>user</span>rather than a fraudster. That always appeared to me to be the weakest link in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-41' style='color:red'>mobile commerce</span>sure you provide the app to the right person instead of a crook. </p><p id=p628><span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-42' style='color:red'>Identity proofing</span>a non-face-to-face environment is anything but easy but there are some decent solutions around that can be stitched together to significantly narrow down the population of fraudulent transactions and identities. The key is reducing reliance on <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-43' style='color:red'>static data</span>much of which is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-44' style='color:red'>PII</span>data that has been compromised by the crooks – and increasing reliance on dynamic data, like reputation, behavior and relationships between <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-45' style='color:red'>non-PII</span>data elements. </p><p id=p699>This problem is only going to get worse as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-46' style='color:red'>Samsung/LoopPay</span>and the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-47' style='color:red'>MCX/CurrentC</span>(supported by Walmart, BestBuy and many other major retailers) release their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-48' style='color:red'>mobile payment systems,</span>the customer data advantages Apple has in their relatively closed environment. </p><p id=p738>Sure, the banks could pressure Apple Pay to make their users take a picture of their credit cards with the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-49' style='color:red'>iPhone</span>and upload that data before signing up. That might work for a short while to deter fraud, at least until the people at underground document forgery sites like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-50' style='color:red'>Scanlab</span>see a new market for their services. </p><p id=p795>But in the end, most banks coming online with Apple Pay are still using customer call centers to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-51' style='color:red'>validate</span>new users, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-52' style='color:red'>leveraging data</span>that can be purchased very cheaply from underground identity theft sites. If any of you doubt how easy it is to buy personal data on just about anyone, check out the story I wrote in December 2014, wherein I was able to find the name, address, Social Security number, previous address and phone number on all current members of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee. </p><p id=p881>The irony here is that while Apple Pay has been touted as a more secure alternative to paying with a credit card, the way Apple and the banks have implemented it actually makes card fraud cheaper and easier for fraudsters. </p><p id=p920>Even more deliciously ironic, as noted in Cherian Abraham's insightful column at Droplabs, is how much of the fraud stemming from crooks signing up stolen credit cards with Apple Pay was tied to purchases of high-dollar Apple products at <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-53' style='color:red'>Apple's</span>own brick-and-mortar stores! That banks end up eating the fraud costs from this activity is just the cherry on top. </p><p id=p978>Abraham said the banks are in this mess because they didn't demand more <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-54' style='color:red'>transparency</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-55' style='color:red'>traceability</span>from <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-56' style='color:red'>Apple before</span>rushing to sign customers up (or "provision" them, in banker-speak) for Apple Pay. </p><p id=p1009>"One of the biggest <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-57' style='color:red'>gripes</span>I have heard from issuers is the lack of transparency from Apple (what did they expect?) and the makeshift reporting provided to issuers that is proving to be woefully inadequate," Abaraham wrote. "As long as issuers fall back on measures easily circumvented by freely available PII – this problem will continue to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-143-58' style='color:red'>leech</span>trust and large sums of cash. And alongside of the latter, there is much blame to go around as well."
