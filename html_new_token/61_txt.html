No service impacts from this vulnerability have been reported to DZS to date. After an internal investigation, we have determined the potential impact is much more limited in scope than previously reported in the media. According to DZS sales records, combined with field data gathered to date, we have estimated that the number of GPON <span class='token pointer' id='tok-61-39' style='color:red'>ONT</span>units that may be potentially impacted to be less than 240,000. In addition, given the relative maturity of the products in their lifecycle, we think the impact is limited to even fewer devices. </p><p id=p498>Product History </p><p id=p500>The <span class='token pointer' id='tok-61-40' style='color:red'>DZS ZNID-GPON-25xx</span>certain H640-series ONTs, including the software that introduced this vulnerability, were developed by an OEM supplier and resold by DZS. While designed and released more than 9 years ago, most of these products are now well past their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-61-41' style='color:red'>sustainable service life.</span>software <span class='token pointer' id='tok-61-42' style='color:red'>support contracts</span>no longer offered for most of these products, we do not have direct insight to the total number of units that are still actively used in the field. </p><p id=p578>Resolution </p><p id=p579>DZS has informed all the customers who purchased these models of the vulnerability. We are working with each customer to help them assess methods to address the issue for units that may still be installed in the field. It will be up to the discretion of each customer to decide how to address the condition for their deployed equipment. </p><p id=p638>UPDATE 2. Dasan has provided some clarifications regarding its claims that customers have not reported any service impact due to these vulnerabilities: </p><p id=p660>DZS' direct customers are the service providers that deliver voice and internet services to the consumer. If service providers experience a problem with DZS equipment, they have direct access to our technical support response teams located throughout the world, 24-hours a day, 7-days a week. To date, none of our technical support response teams have been notified of a single exploitation of this vulnerability on the potentially affected products by any of these service providers. </p><p id=p735><span class='token pointer' id='tok-61-43' style='color:red'>Related: Remotely Exploitable Vulnerability</span>in MikroTik's RouterOS </p><p id=p742>Related: Flaws Affecting Top-Selling Netgear Routers Disclosed
