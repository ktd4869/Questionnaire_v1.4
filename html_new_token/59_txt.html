Customers who are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-59-78' style='color:red'>deploying</span>products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying <span class='token pointer' id='tok-59-79' style='color:red'>hardware,</span>as well as the operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question," the company said. </p><p id=p772>The Xen Project revealed that systems running any version of Xen are impacted. </p><p id=p785>"New <span class='token pointer' id='tok-59-80' style='color:red'>microcode,</span>and possibly a new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-59-81' style='color:red'>firmware</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-59-82' style='color:red'>image</span>is required to prevent SMM data from being <span class='token pointer' id='tok-59-83' style='color:red'>leaked</span>with this vulnerability," Xen developers explained. "Software updates to Xen (details below) are required to prevent guests from being able to leak data belonging to Xen or to other guests in the system." </p><p id=p835>Red Hat has published both technical and high level materials describing the Foreshadow flaws. The company is working on updates that should make it easier for its users to implement mitigations. </p><p id=p866>The list of Linux distributions that have also published advisories includes Suse, Debian, Gentoo and Ubuntu.
