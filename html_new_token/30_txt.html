In 2006 the first PQCrypto Conference was hosted, bringing together researchers to look for secure alternatives against quantum computing attacks. At the time, some alternatives were already at hand, such as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-55' style='color:red'>McEliece encryption (1978),</span>ever since many programs to fund research in PQCrypto have been launched. This includes the European Commission's <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-56' style='color:red'>SAFECrypto,</span>a program for the development of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-57' style='color:red'>quantum-resistant</span>lattice-based cryptography, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-58' style='color:red'>and CryptoWorks21,</span>a Canadian program to develop next-generation <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-59' style='color:red'>quantum-safe cryptographic tools</span>the 21st century. The outcome of all these efforts towards PQCrypto is a huge advance in the field that has already provided post-quantum candidates that meet all desired features of like efficiency and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-60' style='color:red'>key-size</span>comparable to classic algorithms. </p><p id=p659>PQCrypto does not entail any special hardware. It is like classic <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-61' style='color:red'>crypto,</span>but built on problems that are infeasible even for large quantum computers. PQCrypto algorithms have been designed to fulfill the services provided by classic crypto and many of them are able to run even on the most limited <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-62' style='color:red'>platforms.</span></p><p id=p710>How will PQCrypto evolve? Even in a quantum world, current <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-63' style='color:red'>security protocols</span>continue to be as secure as they are today if their design assumptions are fulfilled using post-quantum cryptosystems. Thus, we should see a gradual adoption of modern PQCrypto algorithms by existing protocols over the coming years. </p><p id=p759>We should see a decline in the use of public-key algorithms most used nowadays, such as RSA and Elliptic Curves. In cases like <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-64' style='color:red'>symmetric crypto</span>hash functions, the current parameters will have to be revisited (usually doubled) to ensure that they stay secure in a quantum world. This shift to modern algorithms should happen transparently to end users; however, whoever is responsible for development or configuration of security applications should be ready for the coming changes – in particular, those who support these functionalities in </p><p id=p847>By way of speculating on how long it will take until large quantum computers are able to perform attacks on cryptosystems set with today's parameters, let's assume that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-65' style='color:red'>Moore's law</span>be valid throughout the development of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-66' style='color:red'>quantum computation.</span>algorithm requires roughly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-67' style='color:red'>3 log2(N) qubits</span>factor an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-68' style='color:red'>integer N</span>means that <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-69' style='color:red'>Shor's algorithms</span>roughly <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-70' style='color:red'>qubits</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-71' style='color:red'>6K</span>break <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-72' style='color:red'>RSA-2048),</span>whereas Moore's law states that the number of bits – qubits here – that can be packed into a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-73' style='color:red'>circuit</span>doubles every 12-24 months. </p><p id=p934>As an exercise, let's take a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-74' style='color:red'>5-qubit</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-75' style='color:red'>quantum computer</span>as the one made available online by IBM this month; then the total number of qubits available to run Shor's algorithm after <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-76' style='color:red'>M cycles</span>Moore's law can be calculated as 5 * 2M, therefore taking 18 months as an average cycle span of Moore's law, we end up with approximately 16 years from now until attacks against RSA-2048 become feasible – it takes 16.5 years to go over 11 cycles of Moore's law; this results in the availability of 10K qubits (more precisely 10240=5*211) after this period, which is able to supply the 6K qubits required to run the aforementioned attack. The same magnitude of qubits goes for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-77' style='color:red'>Grover's algorithm</span>around 3,000 and 7,000 logical qubits") to mount attacks against AES, so that their security level will be halved within that period of time. It means that if our assumptions hold, in sixteen years <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-78' style='color:red'>AES-256</span>will be as secure as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-79' style='color:red'>AES-128</span>is today and AES-128 will be broken. Therefore, if we recall the time taken by Elliptic Curves until it was ready for wide deployment, we realize that clock is ticking for PQCrypto. </p><p id=p1128>What should I care about and what should I do?A topic that will have major impact along with the advance of quantum computing is long-term security, which can be related to: </p><p id=p1159><span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-80' style='color:red'>Long-term authenticity;</span>as the life span of a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-30-81' style='color:red'>digitally-signed contractLong-term confidentiality;</span>legal grounds – for instance, the German Legal Code stipulates that medical data must remain confidential even after the patient´s death – or for strategic reasons, such as organization or government secretsLong-term authenticity can be accomplished using simple techniques, like re-signing a document using secure algorithms for as long as needed. Nonetheless, this possibility has to be foreseen and guaranteed by the underlying laws or any system of rules in place; otherwise it will also be threatened by the advance of quantum computation.
