<p id=p0>The recent <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-0' style='color:red'>global</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-1' style='color:red'>ransomware</span>attacks that have dominated <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-2' style='color:red'>television</span>news and headlines across the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-3' style='color:red'>UK</span>and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-4' style='color:red'>Europe</span>should be a call to arms for <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-5' style='color:red'>organisations</span>around the world. Hundreds of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-6' style='color:red'>thousands</span>of computers in more than 150 countries have been affected and organisations are clearly under siege as <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-7' style='color:red'>cybercriminals</span>execute <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-8' style='color:red'>campaigns</span>that spread fast and cause damage. But, why have so many organisations been affected? </p><p id=p65>  </p><p id=p66>Most organisations tend to build their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-9' style='color:red'>security strategy</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-10' style='color:red'>defence-in-depth,</span>which is defined by risk assessment. Since not all applications present the same level of risk if they were to be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-11' style='color:red'>compromised,</span>a defence-in-depth approach (the first <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-12' style='color:red'>pillar</span>of security strategy) consists of assessing the risk and then applying controls and protections accordingly. For example, a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-13' style='color:red'>partner-facing application</span>proprietary and financial information is shared, may present more risk than an <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-14' style='color:red'>internal web page</span>by HR to share general company information. Based on the criticality of the application, risk assessment teams determine the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-15' style='color:red'>security requirements</span>layer the appropriate defences. </p><p id=p167>  </p><p id=p168>This approach worked for a while, but organisations soon realised that even the best defences can be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-16' style='color:red'>hacked.</span>Adversaries make it their <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-17' style='color:red'>mission</span>to successfully <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-18' style='color:red'>navigate</span>obstacle courses of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-19' style='color:red'>layered point products to</span>disrupt or damage what's not theirs. Instead of considering solely what must be <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-20' style='color:red'>protected,</span>organisations also had to look at what could be threatening those assets and added a second pillar to security <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-21' style='color:red'>operations</span>– <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-22' style='color:red'>surveillance.</span></p><p id=p238>  </p><p id=p239>The objective with surveillance is to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-23' style='color:red'>detect</span>and respond to threats. This has proven to be a challenge since a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-24' style='color:red'>defence-in-depth strategy</span>left many companies with 40+ security products and vendors in 40+ <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-25' style='color:red'>silos.</span>What's more, since these products aren't integrated, organisations are left only partially protected, facing a massive <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-26' style='color:red'>data management challenge</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-27' style='color:red'>each layer in the architecture</span>its own logs and events. Worryingly, but sadly unsurprisingly, recent <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-28' style='color:red'>ESG research</span>that 42 <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-29' style='color:red'>percent</span>of security professionals say that their organisation ignores a significant number of <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-30' style='color:red'>security alerts</span>to the volume, and more than 30 percent say they ignore more than half! In most cases, it is the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-31' style='color:red'>security operators</span>the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-32' style='color:red'>Security</span>Operations Centre <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-33' style='color:red'>(SOC)</span>that find themselves drowning in this data as they undertake the onerous task of manually <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-34' style='color:red'>correlating logs</span>events for investigations and other activities. </p><p id=p383>  </p><p id=p384>In an attempt to overcome the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-35' style='color:red'>data overload challenge</span>lighten the heavy burden on analysts, <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-36' style='color:red'>security information and event management,</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-37' style='color:red'>'SIEM',</span>emerged as a way to <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-38' style='color:red'>store</span>all this data and <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-39' style='color:red'>aggregate and correlate logs</span>events. The SIEM has been the tool of choice for SOCs to look at logs and events and determine if they are <span class='token pointer' id='tok-159-40' style='color:red'>noise, false positives,</span>real threats that warrant escalation.
