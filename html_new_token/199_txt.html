The new wiper attack variants are more sophisticated, dangerous, and one in particular, StoneDrill, is more elusive than ever. </p><p id=p141>What Is <span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-6' style='color:red'>Disk Wiper Malware</span>Why Is It So <span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-7' style='color:red'>Nefarious?</span>Disk wiper is a malware that's been used in <span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-8' style='color:red'>cyber</span><span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-9' style='color:red'>espionage</span>attacks, mainly against oil companies and governmental organizations in Saudi Arabia. Wiper malware is designed to first exfiltrate data and then to cover its tracks by wiping the data from the machine, either by deleting it or overwriting it with garbage data. Shamoon specifically deletes the <span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-10' style='color:red'>master boot record (MBR)</span>a <span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-11' style='color:red'>PC,</span>making the machine unable to start.

That's how Shamoon gained notoriety back in 2012. The Shamoon campaign destroyed 35,000 workstations at Saudi Arabia's state-own oil company, Saudi Aramco. <span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-15' style='color:red'>Then-U.S. Defense Secretary</span>Panetta described the attack as, "probably the most destructive attack the business sector [had] seen to date."(1) </p><p id=p293>While the Shamoon campaign primarily targeted Saudi companies, a wave of similar-style wiper attacks soon followed, notably targeting major Asian financial institutions (DarkSeoul, 2013) and Sony Corp (Destover, 2014). Since then, however, Shamoon had all but disappeared. </p><p id=p330>Then, like a terrible sequel that no one wanted to see, Shamoon recently resurfaced in late 2016 in waves of targeted cyber espionage campaigns against private companies and governmental organizations in the Gulf Region and beyond. </p><p id=p366>StoneDrill and Shamoon 2.0, New <span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-16' style='color:red'>Wiper Attacks</span>on the RiseA new <span class='token pointer' id='tok-199-17' style='color:red'>variant</span>of Shamoon, Shamoon 2.0, emerged in November 2016 and January 2017 in two separate attacks against multiple private companies and government and civic organizations in Saudi Arabia.
